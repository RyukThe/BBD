So, compaines want to share their information for that they start creating website to promot and share the information. So, compaines hire the HTML author to create the HTML pages for them. So, HTML author design the web site using HTML and CSS this pages are static pages. It's a simple page there are hyperlinks are present so by using them user can jump from one page to another. So, That time web pages are not intractive.  \n",
        "So, in 1993, a good browser have come to view the web page, mosac is the popular browser that time, then developers of mosac start their own company i.e. netscape. So Netscape create their own browser called Netscape navigator, this is paid broswer. Then big comapines like microsoft create it's browser i.e. Internet explore which is free. So, to compete with the microsoft Netscape collab with Sun microsystem (Java developer) they come with idea can we add interactivity to static web page. So they come with idea to create new lanuage so Netscape hire Brendan Eich who is working on Scheme Programming Language. They told to Brendan to create new langague by which user an interact with page page. So, Brendan create a new language in just 10 days. As it develope in just short period their some bugs, issues and awesome features. From then to now many advancment is done in this language. But there still bug in this which come from due to backward compatibility. The Name of  **Language is Mocha** While launching the they Change the name to the LiveScript. After that promot and market in Language in market. This is only use in Netscape browser, so to use this you pay. After sometime in 1995 they change the name  to JavaScript. Due to popularity of Java that time they use this name, and  this Language have some features of java, c, cpp, still in 1995 this only use in Netscape navigator.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, Microsoft perform reverse enginnering on JavaScritp, create their own Language and they give name to  this Language JScript. So that time, there two lanugage 1. JavaScript which work on only Netscape and 2. JScript is  work only IE. So, while developing the lanauge this website only work on specific browser i.e. best viewed in IE and best viewed netscape. As IE is free so mostly user are using IE Jscript.   \n",
        "Then Netscape go to the ECMA internationl (Eupropian computer Manifature association) this are responsible to create standard so, that there tow language to do one thing, there nothig common, so to create standard JavaScript become the standarad language so that can be use by anyone. Then ECMA use JavaScript and create standard called ECMAScript, so the ECMAScript have standard rules, defination and protocol. Means if your using any laugange which following ECMAScript weather it is JavaScript or JScript it will work on any browser.\n",
        "ECMAScript give standard to C#, dart, C, CPP.  \n",

        "In 2000, dot come bubul is burst. To develope and manage your won website the market cap of comapnies needs to very high. So, Netscape got sold to Aol. Before selling company them make source of Netcape and make it open source so that anyone can use it. Morzella FireFox is recranation of Netscape navigator.   \n",

So, Google introduce new engine i.e. V8 engine, now JavaScript file have both compiled file and interpreted file also. They introduce Just In Time Compiler. So, now they come up with idea can we use JavaScript on our machine / OS as it is easy and fast, to do this the new environment is introduce i.e. nodejs it's environment which have JavaScript engine which help to run Js code on our machine. In the same year of 2009 we get ES5 version, from this js is used to create web frontend, backend, desktop application, web application, server site inshort all kind of application.\n",

        "Array is non-primetive data type, in which we can store muliple values, values are store in index format.\n",
        "## way's to declare array\n",
        "1. using Array() method i.e. constructor method. like   \n",
        "let values = new Array() // empty array\n",
        "2. using [] square bracet and assigning to the variable, values are enclosed in square bracket and sepratated by comma's\n",
        "let values = [] // empty array   \n",
        "\n",
        "**In, js we can store hetro-genious data in array, we can store multiple data of any type also.**\n",
        "* we can add number, string, object, function, all type of values.\n",
        "* By using, length attribute we can get the length of array.\n",
        "* By using push() methods, we can push /insert values in array. or by using array_name[indexnumber] = value   \n",
        "* Inside the array values are store in index format. we can fetch the values from array using index number. Indexes start from 0.\n",
        "Note: When we try to get value of index number greater than length of array then in this case we get **undefined** we dont get any error.\n",
        "## Methods under Array\n",
        "1. push(value): This method is used to add/insert values in array at last index / at the end of array this method will return the length of array after inserting value. We can add multiple values.   \n",
        "arr.push('value inserted')   \n",
        "2. pop(): This method will used to remove the last element (pop is based on last-in first out i.e. stack, last-in first-out, element which is added at last will remove first.)\n",
        "3. shift(): This method will push all the element to the left hand side and remove the first element.\n",
        "4. unshift() : This method shift values to the right hand side, and insert element at first index. and this method will also return the lenght of array also after inserting value. in unshift also we can add multiple values.  \n",
        "both shift and unshift move all element which take more time.\n",
        "5. splice(): In this method we have to pass range from which index to how many elements we want to remove the values.\n",
        "like, ex.   \n",
        "arr.splice(2,1)// this will remove element on index 2.  \n",
        "6. forEach(): This method will return  one value at a time. (one by one) This method will one value at time then we store that value and perform operation on that. So, in forEach() we have pass function as parameter then we have to accept the value return by forEach method then in function which we are passing to forEach we can perform operation on that number.\n",
        "let nums = [2,1,20, 992, 192]   \n",

        "Here, forEach() method will return value one by one. In parenthesis of forEach method we create / pass method which accepting number from foreach one by one and we are printing in using inner function.\n",
        "Note : forEach can take three parameter 1st number, 2nd index_number, 3rd array as it is. *forEach() this is callback method which call again and again depending on number of element present inside a array.*  \n",
        "nums.forEach((n,i,num)=>{} ), then we have to pass the function.\n",
        "7. filter(): The filter() method in JavaScript creates a new array containing only the elements from the original array that pass a specified test/condition (a callback function returns true). It does not modify the original array.   \n",
        "After filtering the values one the same we can use the forEach to get the values one by one.   \n",
        "let num = [2, 29, 23, 24, 39, 40]   \n",
        "   num.filter((n)=>n % 2 ===0)  \n",

        "    console.log(n)  \n",
        "   })    \n",
        "Here, on array we apply filter using filter() this will return even number then we call forEach() which get element one by one.\n",
        "8. map(): this function will get each value from original array, it does not change the orginal array, Its primary use is to transform each element of an array into something new. it will return The new array will have the same length as the original array, but its elements will be the results of the callback function.   \n",
        "let num = [2, 29, 23, 24, 39, 40]  \n",

        "Here, first we are filtering the values then we are changing using the map() then we are get each element.\n",
        "9. reduce(): The reduce() method in JavaScript is a powerful and versatile array method used for reducing an array to a single value. This single value can be a number, a string, an object, another array, or anything else you need.\n",
        "\n",
        "How it Works\n",
        "reduce() executes a reducer callback function on each element of the array, in order, passing in the return value from the calculation on the preceding element. The final result of running the reducer across all elements of the array is a single value.   \n",

        "by using for of loop we can get values from array one by one.\n",
        "Note while creating array if we give first element and last element ex. ar[0] =1 and ar[100] this array have start and end value and inbetween it have 98 empty items and length of array is 100.  \n",
        "By using for of loop it will look the values in array and fetch it one by one.\n",
        "**Note: for in will fetch the key of the object then by using that key we will get the values. But array is also an object when we use for in for array then it will return key i.e. index values then we have to user ar[index] we can get values. But in case of array for of is best to fetch the values.**\n",
