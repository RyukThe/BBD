So, compaines want to share their information for that they start creating website to promot and share the information. So, compaines hire the HTML author to create the HTML pages for them. So, HTML author design the web site using HTML and CSS this pages are static pages. It's a simple page there are hyperlinks are present so by using them user can jump from one page to another. So, That time web pages are not intractive.  \n",
        "So, in 1993, a good browser have come to view the web page, mosac is the popular browser that time, then developers of mosac start their own company i.e. netscape. So Netscape create their own browser called Netscape navigator, this is paid broswer. Then big comapines like microsoft create it's browser i.e. Internet explore which is free. So, to compete with the microsoft Netscape collab with Sun microsystem (Java developer) they come with idea can we add interactivity to static web page. So they come with idea to create new lanuage so Netscape hire Brendan Eich who is working on Scheme Programming Language. They told to Brendan to create new langague by which user an interact with page page. So, Brendan create a new language in just 10 days. As it develope in just short period their some bugs, issues and awesome features. From then to now many advancment is done in this language. But there still bug in this which come from due to backward compatibility. The Name of  **Language is Mocha** While launching the they Change the name to the LiveScript. After that promot and market in Language in market. This is only use in Netscape browser, so to use this you pay. After sometime in 1995 they change the name  to JavaScript. Due to popularity of Java that time they use this name, and  this Language have some features of java, c, cpp, still in 1995 this only use in Netscape navigator.\n",
        "\n",
        "So, Microsoft perform reverse enginnering on JavaScritp, create their own Language and they give name to  this Language JScript. So that time, there two lanugage 1. JavaScript which work on only Netscape and 2. JScript is  work only IE. So, while developing the lanauge this website only work on specific browser i.e. best viewed in IE and best viewed netscape. As IE is free so mostly user are using IE Jscript.   \n",
        "Then Netscape go to the ECMA internationl (Eupropian computer Manifature association) this are responsible to create standard so, that there tow language to do one thing, there nothig common, so to create standard JavaScript become the standarad language so that can be use by anyone. Then ECMA use JavaScript and create standard called ECMAScript, so the ECMAScript have standard rules, defination and protocol. Means if your using any laugange which following ECMAScript weather it is JavaScript or JScript it will work on any browser.\n",
        "ECMAScript give standard to C#, dart, C, CPP.  \n",

        "In 2000, dot come bubul is burst. To develope and manage your won website the market cap of comapnies needs to very high. So, Netscape got sold to Aol. Before selling company them make source of Netcape and make it open source so that anyone can use it. Morzella FireFox is recranation of Netscape navigator.   \n",

So, Google introduce new engine i.e. V8 engine, now JavaScript file have both compiled file and interpreted file also. They introduce Just In Time Compiler. So, now they come up with idea can we use JavaScript on our machine / OS as it is easy and fast, to do this the new environment is introduce i.e. nodejs it's environment which have JavaScript engine which help to run Js code on our machine. In the same year of 2009 we get ES5 version, from this js is used to create web frontend, backend, desktop application, web application, server site inshort all kind of application.\n",
