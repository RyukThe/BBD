Step4: create main method
Step5: create printing statement

1 java project--> multiple packages-->
			1 packages--> multiple classes
				1 class--> multiple method--> main method
					1 main method --> multiple printing statements  --> to print messages
•	Packages can stored n number of classes.
•	When entering package names space are not allowed.
•	Spaces are  allowed in project Name.
•	Sometime creating Project name SRC folder pop  up will appear of create module so always click on don’t create module.
•	Java project Contain n Numbers of packages similarly we can create n number of classes in Packages.
•	Class Name’s First letter Must be in Capital letter.
•	We cannot  Create Multiple main method in class. There is only one main method in class.
•	Syntax of main method 
•	public static void main(String [] args)
{
//Main method body
} 
•	We can add multiple printing statements in main method to print a message 
•	Printing Statement
•	System.out.println();  //printing statement
•	; semicolon is compulsory to close printing statements.



package sample1;    //package name   --> comments

public class Demo1       //class declaration
{
	//class body


	public static void main(String [] args)   //main method declaration
	{
		  //main method body
		System.out.println("Good morning");       //printing statement
				
	}

1.Variables: 
	Variables are nothing but piece of memory use to store information.
        one variable can store 1 information at a time.
     
        Variables also used in information reusability. Means variables can be used multiple times. 

	To utilise variables in java programming language we need to follow below steps:

	1. Variable declaration (Allocating/Reserving memory)
     2. Variable Initialization(Assigning or Inserting value)
	3. Variable Usage


Note:-  According to all programming language dealing with information directly is not a good practice 
	to overcome this variables are introduced.
•	String Type Information( String Datatype):
	Multiple characters are stored in String datatype.
	String can stored information of combination of multiple datatype like characters (alphabet),number and special characters
	String Type information is stored in  a String datatype 
	Example: Amol, Electrical, abc@123,A+.
	String values should be assign in  “   “ double quotation mark. 
	Like  “saurav”, “ram”.

•	int (Integer type information( int Datatype)): size is 4 byte
	int can store numeric + non decimal values or information.
	Example: 100,5,1000,50

•	float (float type information (float Datatype)): size is 4 byte
	float can store all numeric + decimal values.
	Example: 1.5,2.5,100.1,50,000.2 
	float should be assign with f  at  the end of float value like 10.5f, 15.2f. 

•	char ( character type information (char Datatype): 2 byte
	char can stored single character values
	all single character values are stored in char data type
	char should be assign in  ‘  ‘ single quotation mark.
	Like  ‘c’, ‘A’.   

To utilise variables in java programming language we need to follow below steps:

	1. Variable declaration (Allocating/Reserving memory)
     2. Variable Initialization(Assigning or Inserting value)
	3. Variable Usage

1.Variable declaration (Allocating/Reserving memory):
                    	For declaring variable you have to follow the steps:
	
Datatype variablename;

String       studentname;

	Variable can be anything like name place or what ever.
	Spaces are not allowed in variablename.

2. Variable Initialization(Assigning or Inserting value):
If we want to print variable information then only variable declaration is not enough to print value first we need to assign or insert values in variable.

variablename  = “variable value/ what you to enter”;
studentname = “Amol”:

	this type of statement runs the parameters on right hand side first.
	Amol information is stored in studentname which is the variablename  and close with ( ; ) semicolon.

3.	Variable Usage: 
 		If we want to print message then we use “ “ double quotation  mark but when we want to print variable information the “ ‘” double quotation is not used.
 		
		System.out.println (studentname);
		
		Printing statement (variablename);

If we want to reuse variable information we  just recall with a printing statement.







package Variable;

public class sample1
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//amol, electrical,abc@123, xyz,A+   --> multiple characters --> String
		//100, 5, 10000, 50 --> numeric + non-decimal --> int
		//1.5 , 2.5, 100.1,  50,000.2 --> numeric + decimal --> float
		//A, B, C, D -->  single characters --> char
		
		
	}

}
package Variable;

public class sample2 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//1. Variable declaration (Allocating/Reserving memory)
		String studentname;    //datatype variablename
		String studentDept;
		int studentRollNum;
		float studentPer;
		char studentGrade;
		
		
		 //2. Variable Initialization(Assigning or Inserting value)
		studentname = "Amol";   //variablename="variable value";
		studentDept = "Electrical";
		studentRollNum = 101;
		studentPer = 65.5f;
		studentGrade = 'A';		
		
		//3: variable usage
		System.out.println(studentname);
		System.out.println(studentname);   //info reuse
		System.out.println(studentDept);
		System.out.println(studentRollNum);
		System.out.println(studentPer);
		System.out.println(studentGrade);
	}

}
*For to understand anyone or  anyone can read output and will understand what we want showing for this we can use “ “ double quotation marks + (concatenate symbol plus sign) with variablename
*For printing message we use “ “ double quotation mark and for combine message and variablename we use + (concatenate )
System.out.println(“information”+variablename);
Printing statement 
System.out.println(“student Name:”+stdname);
*We can add information before and after  also  by using + (concatenate plus symbol) with variable like:
Syste.out.println(“student percentage:”+stdper”%”);
Program:
package class1;

public class Package1 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String stdname;
		String stddept;
		int stdrollno;
		float stdper;
		char stdgrade;
		
		stdname="Saurav";
		stddept="BCA";
		stdrollno=1054;
		stdper=69.25f;
		stdgrade='A';
		
		System.out.println("Student Name :-> " + stdname);
		System.out.println("Student Department:-> " + stddept);
		System.out.println("Student Roll No.:-> " + stdrollno);
		System.out.println("Student Percenatge:-> " + stdper +"%");
		System.out.println("Student Garde:-> " + stdgrade);
		
	}

}
Data Types:
        Datatype are used to represent type of data or information which we are going to use in our java program.
  
        In java programming it is mandatory to declare datatype before declaration of variable.
*IF we cant declare datatype it’s difficult to understand which type of information is stored in variable.
        In java datatypes are classified into two types :     
        	1. Primitive datatype.
        	2. Non-primitive datatype.

1.Primitive datatype: 
	There are 8 type of primitive datatypes.  These 8 type of primitive datatype are co-defined in four different type as follows
1.	(Numeric plus non-decimal)
2.	(Numeric plus decimal)
3.	Character datatype
4.	Conditional datatype 


	All the primitive datatypes are keywords.    ( In java keyword starts with lower case. It Means all primitive datatype also start with lower case)                   
      * Memory size of primitive datatype are fix.(Means we can’t enter values which are larger than limit of primitive datatype. Otherwise its show error  i.e out of range)
*Sometime int can store 10 digit number also if it’s memory size is less than or equal to range of int which 4 byte.                    
        The types of primitive datatype are: 

	Note:-  keyword starts with lower case 
		Primitive datatype starts with lower case 

syntax:     datatype variablename;  
                          
 1.(Numeric + Non-decimal):-
                             Ex: 80,85,10,5..etc  

	Data Type	Size			
1.	byte		1 byte		
2.	short		2 bytes		
3.	int(imp)		4 bytes		
4.	long		8 bytes		l(while using long data type (I or L) is compulsory mentioned at the ned of long variable like
			long Mobileno=8554803655l;  


1GB=1024MB
1MB=1024KB
1KB=1024Byte
1Byte= 8bit
             
  2.(Numeric + decimal):-
                             Ex: 22.5,22.8,6.4.... 

5.      float(imp)       4 byte   f
6.      double		 8 byte   d
  
                          
3. Single Character :-
                             Ex: A,B,X,Z.

7.	char		 2 byte
(if we add /assign numeric value in char then it will char present on that asci value) Note: when we pass / store number in char ch=4 then it return the charchter present on that number. 

4. Conditional:-
                              Ex:  true,false.

8.      boolean		1 bit	


----

2. Non-primitive datatype:
	There are 3 types of non primitive datatypes .
	all the Non primitive datatypes are identifiers. (Identifier starts with capital letter. So non-primitive datatype is also Identifier means first letter of Non-primitive datatype is also capital.)
*ClassName is also datatype
i.e. String , classname and interface name is works as non-primitive datatype 

      * Memory size of non primitive datatype is not defined or not fix. We can add or stored as many data or information in it.

Note:	Identifier starts with capital letter.
	Non-primitive datatype starts with capital letter.
Reference Data Types:
•	classes: user-defined data types
•	arrays: collections of elements of the same type
•	interfaces: contract defining methods and constants

                      e.g.  String, className
program:
package Variable;

public class Sample2
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		
//		int num2;       //4 byte
//		num2=9999999999;
		
		long num1;          //8 byte
		num1=9999999999l;
		System.out.println(num1);
		
		
		String s1;
		s1="nsddaadsdbbwbaa jkjjj jwjjbd  knwkfwfkww  wbwbb";
		System.out.println(s1);
	}

}
Methods:
A method is block of code which only runs when its called
Block means whatever  entered or code entered in { } is called block.
{ 
Public static void main(String [] args)
{
}
Like main method is also block is run when we called main method by using method name.The block of code is run by JVM (Java Virtual Machine)  JVM control all our program like which class is to run all things are controlled by JVM 
•	JVM has compiler it sent compiler to the particular class and check for main method is present or not if present in class body then program will run or execute otherwise it throws error that main method not found.
•	If main method is not declared program execution is not possible.
•	Methods are used to preform certain action and they are also knowns function.( methods are use to perform some operation like to print something by using printing statement or to perform addition of  two number etc. for perform any operation we use methods.)
•	 In every class there is only one main method in single class. More than one main methods are not possible in single class.

We have two types of methods available in java
1.	main method(predefined/system defined function)
2.	Regular method(User defined function)
1. main method:
o	In  any java program main method is the starting point of program which compiler start program execution,
So , the compiler needs to all the main() method.
Without main method we can’t run any java program.
o	Syntax of main method is fix we can’t change it.

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Code goes here
}
•	public: It is an access modifier that makes the main method accessible to other classes.
•	static: It indicates that the main method belongs to the class itself, rather than an instance of the class.
•	void: It specifies that the main method does not return any value.
•	main: It is the name of the method and serves as the program's entry point.
•	String[] args: It represents the command-line arguments passed to the program. It is an array of strings.
In simpler terms:

•	The public static void part ensures that the main method can be accessed and executed by the Java runtime system.
•	main is the name of the method that Java looks for when starting the program.
•	String[] args is where you can access any command-line arguments provided when running the program.
The main method in Java is like the "starting point" of a program. It's where the program begins executing. Here's what you need to know:
•	The main method is always written as public static void main(String[] args).
•	public means the main method can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
•	static means the main method belongs to the class itself, not any specific object.
•	void means the main method doesn't return any value.
•	main is just the name of the method. Java looks for this specific name to start the program.
•	String[] args is a way to pass extra information to the program when you run it. You can ignore it for now.
•	In simple terms, String[] args in the main method allows you to access any extra information that you pass to your program when you run it from the command line.
•	When you run a Java program, you can provide additional information as "arguments" to the program. These arguments are like inputs that can be used by your program to perform different actions or make decisions.
Inside the main method, you can write your code. This is where you put the instructions that you want the program to execute. When you run the program, the Java system automatically finds and runs the main method.
Remember, the main method is like the "doorway" to your program. It's where everything starts, and from there, you can write the code to make your program do all sorts of cool things.

2. Regular method:
 We can declare user requirement in regular method. We use any name in regular method. We can use name that user want to enter in regular method.
 Regular method is also have two methods which are
1.	Static regular method
2.	Non-static regular method
1.Static Regular method:
Static regular method is also have two different method which are:
1.	Static regular method call from same class  methodname();
2.	Static regular method call from different/ another class  className.methodname();
1.Static regular method:
o	Static regular method is identify it’s static by verify is static keyword is present.
o	When we run the program JVM only call for main method not for regular method i.e. static regular method we have to call regular method from main method for to call we need to use regular method at any line by using regular method  name like m1();
o	Until main method call for regular method regular method is not run.
o	Static means it’s property  belongs to class.
o	We can use n number of regular method in class or program we can call regular method at any stage in main method.

Static regular method call from same class  methodname();
 In static regular method call from same class suppose there are many regular methods are available in same class then we can call them in main method by entering method name in main method like
{ main method  body
M1();
M2();
}
There can be n number of regular method in same class. 
We can recall regular method as many time as we can.
2.Static regular method call from different/ another class  className.methodname();
	We  also call regular method from another class also by mentioned it into main method of another class.
ClassName.methodName();
{ main method body 
className.methodName();
Sample1.m3();
Smaple3.m4();
}

 



 
Program:
package Methods;

public class sample1 
{
	//1: static regular method call from same class
	
	public static void main(String[] args)  //pre-defined method
	{		
		System.out.println("Hi");
		m1();  // methodname(); 
		m2();
		m2();
		System.out.println("Hello");
	}
	
	//static -> regular method
	public static void m1()      //user defined method
	{
		System.out.println("running method m1");
	}
	
	//static -> regular method
	public static void m2()      //user defined method
	{
		System.out.println("running method m2");
	}
}
 package Methods;

public class sample2
{
	//2: static regular method call from diff class
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		sample3.m3();  //diffclassname.methodname();
		sample3.m4();
		sample3.m4();
		
	}

}
 package Methods;

public class sample3 
{
	//static -> regular method
	public static void m3()
	{
		System.out.println("running method m3 from diff class");
	}
	
	//static -> regular method
	public static void m4()
	{
		System.out.println("running method m4 from diff class");
	}
	
}
Non static regular method:
1.	Non-static methods regular method is can not directly called in main method like calling into main method like static regular method.
2.	To use non-static regular method we use to create new object in main method.
3.	Object creation is done in only main method.
4.	Main method not allow non static regular method directly assigning  in main method because main method is basically in static format it can’t allow non-static regular method directly.it only allow static regular method directly assign using method name.
5.	For calling non static regular method we have to make copy of current class which is called object. In which we can create copy of original class. To create object we have syntax
6.	Non-static means it is property belong to object of class.

className objectname = new className(); // object creation syntax

1.	className  is work as datatype. To verify which class is this we use class name.
2.	objectname  can be any thing like variable to identify that it’s object. Object name is use. To verify which class and all data present in that current class is placed in empty class.
3.	New  is key word to create blank/ or empty object in which we can use it to store value of current class.
4.	className()  is constructor   call is responsible for to copy call data present in current class is coped in blank object and store it. (Constructor copy all member of call including main method if it present in class to an object)
There are tow type of non-static regular method :
1.	non static regular method called from same class
2.	non static regular method  called from different class.

1.non static regular method called from same class;
in this we can calls non static regular method of same class by creating new object in main method and then we will call it in main method by  
{ main method body
ClassName ObjectName=new ClassName();
Objectname.methodename();
S4.m6();
}

2. non static regular method called from different class:
in this we call the non static regular method from different class for that we  create object in class  which contains main method and the name of different class we have values of non static regular method. For this we use following syntax 
{ main method body
diffrentclassName objectname = new diffrentclassName();
sample6 s6 = new sample6();
s6.m7();  //objectname.methodname();
}
 
 




  
 

package methods;

public class Sample4 
{
	//3: non-static method call from same class
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//classname objectname=new classname();    //syntax of object creation
		
		Sample4	s4 = new Sample4();       //step1: create object of same class  
		s4.m5();                          //step2: method call --> objectname.methodname()
		s4.m6();
		s4.m6();
		
		//1. Sample4 -> classname -> datatype
		//2. s4    -> objectname --> to identify/refer object
		//3. new --> keyword   -->  to create blank/empty object
		//4. Sample4()  --> classname() --> constructor call --> to copy all the members of class into  object
	}
	
	
	public void m5()
	{
		System.out.println("running non-static method m5");
	}
	
	public void m6()
	{
		System.out.println("running non-static method m6");
	}


}
Program for non-static regular method from  different class.
package methods;

public class Sample5 
{
	
	//4: non-static method call from diff class
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		Sample6 s6=new Sample6();  //1: create object of diff class 
		s6.m7();				   //2: method call -> diffclassObjectName.methodname();
		s6.m8();
		s6.m8();
		
	}

}
package methods;

public class Sample6 
{
	//non-static regular method
	public void m7()
	{
		System.out.println("running non-static regular method m7 from diff class");
	}
	
	
	//non-static regular method
	public void m8()
	{
		System.out.println("running non-static regular method m8 from diff class");
	}

}
We Can use static and non static regular method together also.
Program: Static and Non static regular method.
public class Sample7
{
	//5: method without parameter
	
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		//1. static regular method call from same class
		m1();      //methodname();
		
		//2. static regular method call from diff class
		Sample8.m2();     //classname.methodname();
		
		//3. non-static regular method call from same class
		Sample7 s7=new Sample7();          //1: create object of same class
		s7.m3();                           //2: method call -> objectName.methodname();
	
		//4. non-static regular method call from diff class
		Sample8 s8=new Sample8();
		s8.m4();
	}

	public static void m1()    //method without parameter
	{
		System.out.println("running static regular method m1 from same class");
	}
	
	
	public void m3()	 //method without parameter
	{
		System.out.println("running non-static regular method m3 from same class");
	}
	
	
}
5.	Method without parameters.
6.	Method with Parameters.
5.  Method without parameters:
•	Means we can’t provide any value in () means suppose following is static regular method 
Public static void main m()
 We never provide value in parenthesis().
•	In method without parameter we are not providing any parameter in () or not providing any input.
•	In method without parameter we can’t give different input in this method every time it only give output which we mentioned method body.
•	We can’t give different input at same time.
 Program: Method without parameters
Package sampl;
Public class class1
{
Public static void main(String [] args)
{
addition();
}

Public static void addition()
{
 int num1= 10;
int num2= 20;
System.out.println(num1+num2);
}
6. Method with parameter:
        You can pass data/input, known as parameters, into a method.


We can provide vale between () paraments is called method with parameters. Suppose we have static regular method.
Public static void m2(int num1,int num2)
{
System.out.println(num1+num2);
}
        Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

We can call this method many times and also we can give different inputs every time.
We can get our desired result.
We can give different input at same time.
1. main method (pre-defined)
	In any Java program, the main() method is the starting point from where compiler starts program execution.
	So, the compiler needs to call the main() method.

	without main method we can't run any java program.

2. Regular method (user defined)
 	
 1. static regular method
	1. static regular method call from same class       --> methodname();
	2. static method call from diffrent/another class   -->className.methodname();
 2. non- static regular method
	3. non-static method call from same class    --> 1. create object of same class  2. objectname.methodname();
	4. non-static method call from diffrent/another class  --> 1. create object of diff class  2. objectname.methodname();


Note: At the time of program execution main method is going to get executed automatically, 
      where as regular methods are not going to get executed automatically.

      At the time of program execution priority is scheduled for main method only.

      To call a regular method we need to make call method call from main method,
      until unless if the method call is not made regular method will not get executed.

      regular methods can be called multiple times.


5. method without/zero parameter
6. method with parameter.
Control Statement:
In Java, control statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions, repeat code, and perform different actions based on specific conditions.
In Java there are three type of control statements: 
1.	Decision-making  statements (if, if-else, & switch)
2.	Lopping statements (while, do while & for)
3.	Jump statement (continue, break, return)  
4.	if :
 we use only if statement  when have single condition. To verify and give output of only positive or true mean output of only one condition then we use if(only).
*if condition statement is use in when we have dealing with single 0r only one condition.
Suppose student have mark >= 35 then show pass. The we use 
{
if(marks>=35)
{
System.out.println(“Pass”);
}
It only show the outout only when the condition is true.
In if the condition is false it don’t give any output.

5.	if else statement:
•	 if  else  are used when we have to check two condition at same time.
•	Only one condition can be run or printed at a time because in conditions there is only two possibilities.
1.	True
2.	False
Suppose we have marks of student mark >= 35 then show pass and if mark is mark<35 then show fail. We write like that.
{
if (mark>=35)
{
System.out.println(“pass”);
}
else
{
System.out.println(“Fail.”);
}
In if else statement we check only two conditions i. true or false.

3. else if :
                   else if statement is used when we have multiple condition to check more than two. In else if we check n number of condition. But at time only one is executed. because compiler start execution  from main method by line by line. If very first condition is true or satisfied then its run this condition and stop execution of other condition mentioned in program. Condition after that not run.
In else if statement we can use else also at the end condition or last condition can be mentioned.in else if we can use else also.

Suppose we have mark of of student and we have two show  suppose marks>=65 the show “ pass with distinction” if mark>=60 & mark<=64. Then show first class if marks is mark>=50 & mark<=59 then  show 2nd class and is mark is mark>=35 & mark<=49 then show pass and if marks is marks<35 then show fail. For that we write like that 
{
if(marks>=65)
		{
			System.out.println("distinction");
		}
		//       32>=60    &  62<=64
		else if (marks>=60  & marks<=64)             //60 - 64 
		{
			System.out.println("1st class");
		}
		//       32>=50   & 55<=59
		else if(marks>=50 & marks<=59)                              //50 - 59
		{
			System.out.println("2nd class");
		}
		//      32>=35   & 40<= 49
		else if (marks>=35 & marks<=49)         //35 - 49
		{
			System.out.println("Pass");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("Fail");
		}
4. Nested if :
When we use if within if statement we use if statement body then its called nested if.
We also called as inner if.
if ()   // is called outer if
{
Sysytem.out.println();
If ()  // inner if
{

}
Else
{
}
}
else  // outer if termination or exit
{
System.out.println();
}

Suppose we have condition like we have to check suppose we are giving mpsc exam then there are two stages first is premains and second is mains if we qualify in premain then only we can eligible of main and if we qualified for main also then only we me select if pass the mains exam otherwise it show not select.

package Control_Statements;

public class example4_nested_if 
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		
		int PEM= 150;
		
		//150>=300
		if(PEM>=300)   //outer if
		{
			System.out.println("Eligible for mains exam");
			int MEM=650; // second condition
			//650>=600
			if(MEM>=600)        //inner / nested if
			{
				System.out.println("Got selected"); // if 2nd condition is true
			}
			Else // inner else
			{
				System.out.println("Rejected: MEM<600"); // if 2nd condition is false
			}
		} //if statement termination
		Else // outer else
		{
			System.out.println("Not Eligible for mains exam");
		}

	}
}

1.	If the condition is true then only it can run the condition which mentioned in if statement by  using the nested if. If the first condition is not true or false then it wil directly run the else after the if which is outer else.
2.	Similarly compiler check inner if condition also is if true then run if  statement if condition is false then it will run else or inner else.

Switch statements:
Switch statement is use when we have many options are available and we have to choose from any one from  that at a time. Then code related to that is executed.

In a Switch statement we cant check  the condition. here in switch statement we check value or input comes from the user.

Suppose we entering card in ATM machine then there are many option are available we need to select one from option to that at time we can perform only one task at time. Like we click balance inquiry then it will run code regarding balance inquiry like these type of cod are created by using switch statement.
Syntax for switch stamen is:
switch()
{
Case 1: System.out.println(“Today is Mon”);
Break;
.
.
.
Default : System.out.println(“invalid input”);
}
 In switch statement we can only use int and string  datatype.
We can directly pass input in switch statement also like,

Switch			(1) 
Control statement 	input
 
Or we can give input by assigning variable also like

int 		n 		= 		1;
datatype 		variablename			value stored in variable

switch			 (n)
control statement 	variablename

 in switch statement there are multiple number of cases for entering multiple cod for multiple inputs. For like when we enter input 1 then code related to that is run like that if we select mini statement input it runs the code related to mini statement.
we can write any code in particular case. 
When we create case caseinput : to close that case statement we use break(keyword) statement . brake statement or terminating or closing that case.
In between brake and colon of case we can give multiple statement or printing statements.
Suppose user entering false value or giving  invalid input for that we use default code for understanding user to enter valid input.
Syntax of default code is
Default: System.out.println(“enter valid input”);
Switch statement:
package Control_Statements;

public class example5_Switch3
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		
		switch("CD")
		{
		case "BI": System.out.println("running BI code");
		break;
		
		case "CD": System.out.println("running CD code");
		break;
		
		case "CW": System.out.println("running CW code");
		break;
		
		case "MT": System.out.println("running MT code");
		break;
		
		case "MS": System.out.println("running MS code");
		break;
		
		default: System.out.println("Wrong Input");
		
		}
		
		
		
		
	}

}
Loops Statement:
1.	For loop : 
when we have to perform repeated operation we use loop statement. For loop is used when we know the number of interation in advanced. 
means we have to print number from 1 to 5 or we have to print one statement repeated time or etc for to perform repeated operation we use loop statement.
 suppose if we don’t use loop and we want to print one statement 10 time then we have to use this print statement for 10 times using separate prints statement for ten time it will print that one statement 10 time. But suppose we have to print 1000 time then it not possible to print same statement 1000 time it will take to much time to over come this we use loop statement by using this we can print 1000 statement or number between 1 to 1000 easily. 
When we use for loop then 3 thing are important which are 
1.	Start number 
2.	End number (condition)  
3.	Increment number like by 1,2 or3
 Syntax for loop:
for(start number; end  number condition; increment  by)
ex. 
for( int 	                   i	=	     1	  ; 	                          i<=5;	i++)
        datatype      variablename     value stored in variable         condition  increment by 1
i<=5 means all the value from 1 to 5 is print
i++ use in java for increment by 1
for(int i=1; i<=5; i++)
{
System.out.println(i);
}
For printing statement  is use to print i  value from 1 to 5
How for loop works:
At starting first value is  i value which 1  Or i=1 then compiler check end number condition which is i<=5 then i=1 which les than equal to 5 condition is true then compiler goes through the body of loop and execute printing statement that i=1 it will print 1 now here we increment value by 1 now once body executed compiler goes for third parameter which is i++ now we have i current value is 1 and its increment by 1 which 2 and after 3rd parameter again compiler comes to second parameter and check end number condition i.e value is 2 and which is less than equal to 5 check condition and condition is true it print I current value which is 2 same process is repeated until condition is true i<=5  it stop execution and end value is 5. If condition is false compiler will not enter or visit body of loop.
When we increment by 2 we use i= 1+2 formula
When we have = sign then complier execute parameter on right hand side first and store output of that into left side of variable.
 We we println for new line to get output on new line.
While we incrementing we use <= less than equal to sign condition while decrementing we use >=  greater than equal to sign.
For Decrement :
Means suppose we have print number or any thing in reverse order we use dcremnt operation for decrement we give last number which is 5 in this case and then first number which is  1 in condition and then decrement sing i.e i--.
Syntax for decrement is 
for (int i = 5;i>=1;i--)
int is data type 
i is variable name
 i >=1 condition to print last number is equal to 1
i --  for decrementing by 1
example: 
for (int i=5;i>=1;i--)
{
System.out.println(i);
}
Here  for decrement first compiler take input i=5 then check with condition its true then its enters in loop body and executed print statement and give out i is equal to five then after executing printing statement then it check third parameter i.e. i—decrement operation by 1 for now our current value of i value is 5 after decrement this value by 1 we get 4 then compiler check second parameter condition that i>=1 which is again true then compiler execute printing statement we get our output 4 then again and again this process is repeated until condition get false. When compiler get value 0 which is less than zero condition get false compiler stop execution of loop. 
We can also decrement by 2, 3 or whatever we want. Suppose we want to decrement by 2 then formula is i=i-2; similarly i=i-3; …
Here we print high to low mean 20 is first 1 is last.
Suppose by using we want to print same statement repeated time then also we use for loop.
For to this following is example.
For(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
System.out.println(“hi”);
}
Here we will get output hi time because we enter “hi” message in printing statement rather than variable name.
We can also use for loop for printing square 1 to 7 when we have conditio like this to we print first 1to 7 number first 
for(int  i= 1; i<=7;i++)
{
System.out.println(i*i);
}
Here we performing multiplication operation to get square of that number or value of i is multiply by i. Similarly we cant get cube of 1 to 7 also by multiplying them 3 time i*i*i* in printing statement.
2.	While loop: 
While loop is same as like for loop only syntax of while is different. Overall working for loop and while loop is same. While loop is used when we don’t know the  number of iteration or loop should continue based on condition then while loop is used. 
Syntax  of while loop:
int i =1; // start number using variable
while (i<=5) // end number condition
{
System.out.println(i);
i++; // increment operation increment by 1

}
 When we use for loop we directly provid value in bracket (start number, end number condition, increment or decrement) of for loop bracket.
But in  while loop we declare start number first using i.e
int 		i	=		1	;
datatype    variablename		value stored in variablename
while(i<=5) we mentioned end number condition in while loop bracket.
{
Syste.out.println(i);
i++; increment/decrement  operation in is mentioned in while loop body
}
Here compiler check start number which is 1 now it check condition in while bracket i.e i<=5 which is true the it enters in body of and print I value which is 1. Here now compiler increment value of I which is 1 to 2  and check with condition and print i current value which 2. Similarly repeat the same process until end number is executed.
Like increment we also perform decrement operation and all operation  which performed in for loop.
3.	Do While Loop:
 We dont use do while loop in  real time. Is used when we have condition that loop must be run at leat once rather than checking condition then we can use do while loop. 
Syntax for do while
{
Int i=1; // start number
Do
{
System.out.println(i);
I++;
}
while (i<=5) ;// end number
in do while we give start number out side do loop in do loop body we can call variable by using printing statement and perform increment or decrement operation and we give end number conation in out side do loop in while () i.e while (i<=5).
In do while loop compiler directly print start print start number it can not check condition while printing printing start number from second number it started checking condition until condition is get false.
Variables. There are two types variable.
1)	Local variable
2)	Global variable
1). Local variable:
 the variable which is declared in side the method like main method or regular method is called local variable.
Local variable are declared in the body of methods.
Scope of local variable is remain only within the method.
We can use local variable in only within method in  which we declared it.
We cant use this out side of method.
Local variable is also called as temporary variables.
 Syntax of local variable is
Public static void m1()
{
int a=10; \\ local variable
System.ot.println(a);
}
2.) Global variable:
 Variable is declared outside method is called as global variable.
Scope of global variable is remains throughout class means we can use global variable in through out class in all methods by calling it.
Global variable is also called as permanent variable.
Global variable is also have two types:
1)	Static Global Variable
2)	Non Static Variable.
We can give same name to variable in same class.
1.	Static global variable:
 if no keyword like static before a variable is called non static variables.
1)	Is static keyword is  added before variable is called static variable.
1) static global variable call from same class 
2) static global variable call from different class.
1) Static Global variable call from same Class:
 For Printing variable value we have to use printing statement and as a variable is static from the same class we can directly use it in printing statement like.
System.out.println(variable Name);
2) Static Global variable Call from different class :
If we want to call static variables from different class the we have syntax as its variable so have to use printing statement for print variable value.
Syntax is
System.out.println(Sample3.b);
// (DiffrentClassName.VariableName)
2.	Non-static global variable:
Non static global variables where there is no static keyword is present before the variable. i.e.
int a=10;
{
Public static void main(String [] agrs)
}
To call non static global variable from same class like non static regular method we have to create object first for same class
ClassName ObjectName= new ClassName();
To call non static variable from same class we have to create object first then in printing we have to call non static variable by using ObjectName.Variablename
Syntax is 
System.out.println(ObjectName.VariableName);
Non static global variable call from different class:
We can call non static variable of different class also for  that we have to create object first.
Syntax for that:
DiffrentClassName ObjectName= new diffrentClassName();
Then for to call non static variable we have to call by using ObjectName.VariableName  in printing statement.
Syntax is:
System.out.println(ObjectName.VariableName);
We cant call non static variable in static methods directly we have to create object first.
But we can directly call in non static variable in non static regular method.
Java Keywords: (52 keywords)
Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in Java programming that have special meanings to the compiler. For example:
Keywords always start with lower case small character.
We can not use keyword as a class name, variable name or package name.
•	 abstract	•	assert	•	boolean	•	break	•	byte
•	case	•	catch	•	char	•	class	•	const (not used)
•	continue	•	default	•	do	•	double	•	else
•	enum	•	extends	•	final	•	finally	•	float
•	for	•	goto (not used)	•	if	•	implements	•	import
•	instanceof	•	int	•	interface	•	long	•	native
•	new	•	null	•	package	•	private	•	protected
•	public	•	return	•	short	•	static	•	strictfp
•	super	•	switch	•	synchronized	•	this	•	throw
•	throws	•	transient	•	try	•	void	•	volatile
•	while				


Java identifiers
Identifiers are the name given to variables, classes, methods, package etc
Identifies particular thing by name of that thing.

Rules for Naming an Identifier
	1. Identifiers cannot be a keyword.
	2. Identifiers are case-sensitive. Means if we specify variable in capital and we are calling in small case then its not possible.
	3. It can have a sequence of letters and digits. However,
	   it must begin with a letter, $ or _. The first letter of an identifier cannot be a digit.
                     Example of identifiers int saurav=1;
int 1r=1 ; s not allowed case identifiers can not start with number.

4.	It's a convention to start an identifier with a letter rather and $ or _.
Example of identifiers
int _r=1; int $n=5;
5.	Whitespaces are not allowed in between variable name , class name and package name. Similarly, we cannot use symbols such as @, #, and so on. We only use _ (under score) and $ (dollar sign) as a identifiers.

public static void main (String [] args)
   main is also a identifiers 
 public static void m1 ();
m1 is also identifiers. 
Constructor: 
	A constructor in Java is a special member of class that is used to initialize global objects/variables
In java there is constructor is always available in class which called as default constructor.
There are two types of constructor
1.	Default constructor
2.	User defined constructor 
1.	Default constructor 
If suppose user don’t define any constructor then in java complier can create constructor called as default constructor.
While creating objects its mandatory to that constructor is available weather is user defined or default constructor.
Default constructor is available in class by internally we cant see this by our side because its provided by compiler
Syntax of constructor is 
ClassName()
{
}
Sample1()
{
}
Its syntax of default constructor 
If there is no user defined constructor then we use default constructor provided by compiler.
Use of default constructor is to copy all the member of class or all data of class into a object created by using  new keyword.
When we have non static method to call this method in main method we have to call from main method by creating object first
Syntax for object creation is:
ClassName ObjectName = new ClassName();
Sample1 S1= new Sample1();
Then by using ObjectName.MethodName we can call method to main method.
S1.m1();
ObjectName.MethodName();
1)	Sample1 is className and is used as datatype
2)	S1 ObjectName for identify or verify the object.
3)	new is keyword which create empty / blank object.
4)	Sample1() classname() is work as constructor is use for to copy all data from Class into object.
User defined Constructor:
The constructor created by user is called user defined constructor.
We Create user defined constructor we declare global variable. In java we can initialize  global variable in user defined constructor when its available
USE of user defined constructor:
1)	User defined constructor are used to initialize global variable
2)	User defined constructor is used to copy all the data from class into the object.
When we have non-static global variable or non-static regular method the its mandatory to create object first. Object creation syntax is 
ClassName objectName=new ClassName();
Objectname.methodname();
Syntax of user defined Constructor is :
ClassName()
{
}
Example:
Sample();
{
}
Constructor is important to create object of class
We can also call the non-static global variable of different class also. To call non static regular method we have syntax 
differentClassName object = new DifferentClassName();
obj.methodName();
we can use non-static global variable in n number of methods
while calling static global variable and static regular method we don’t have to create any object.there is no need of any constructor 
constructor is only use when it call from the object or while creating object by 4 th parameter of object creation syntax which is constructor call.
Use defined constructor I also have two type 
1)	User defined constructor without parameter means no value provide into () parenthesis 
2)	User defined Constructor with parameters.
User Defined Constructor With Parameters:
 We can give parameters to by assigning values in user defined constructor in () like className(int a,int b) // (local variables) this is user defined constructor with two integer parameters.
We use user defined with parameters to give different value at every time  when we call it into object.
ClassName(int a, int b) int a & int b are local variables because its declare in constructor body we use only in constructor so if want to provide values from main method then its not possible so for that we assign these local variable information to global variables to give different input every time for that we initialize global variable in constructor body by 
{
Num1 		=	a;
Global Variable		local Variable
Num2 		= 	b;
}
Here we provide value to global variable by using local variable.
By sending local variable information to global variable so by which we perform operation by sending different input every time.
We perform operation on global variables.
Now we can perform operation by giving different values to constructor when we call constructor from main method to  non static method to call non static method we have to create object first syntax is for that 
ClassName ObjectName= new ClassName();
And 
In ClassName() now we can give value like (10,20) this assign to a and b then it store in global variable Num1 and Num2 each time when we Create new object we can provide different values.
We also call user defined constructor with parameters from different class also by using creating object different class syntax is 
diffrentClassName ObjectName = new differentClassName();
we can provide values in() like (a,b) or (10,20) 
User defined multiple Constructor with different parameters are Called As Constructor Overloading :
In class we create can  multiple constructor for declaring multiple constructor in one class for that we have to create one without parameters one integer parameters one string parameters
When we create object then we get option of all constructor which we declare outside method body. At time we can not call two constructor if we cerate object the at time we create only one constructor at time. We can call constructor as we want use we can use another constructor by creating another object.
While creating constructor name of class and constructor should be as classname.  In which class we creating constructor then class name and constructor should be same but parameters should be different at every time. Suppose we create two constructor containing 2 integer parameters like
ClassName(int a,int b)
ClassName(int a,int b)
Then its not allowed we have use different parameters like three integers or string or simple different parameters.
We can create n number of constructor in class but there is condition that is constructor name and class name is same always and parameters are different at every time.

Constructor:
	A constructor in Java is a special member of class that is used to initialize global objects/variables. 
	The constructor is called when an object of a class is created.

	At the time of constructor declaration below points need to follow:
		1. Constructor name should be same as class name
		2. you should not declare any return type for the constructor(like void).
		3. Any number of constructor can be declared in a java class but constructor name should be same as class name,
		   but arguments/parameter should be different--> Constructor overloading.

	Use of Constructor
		1. To copy/load all members of class into object  --> when we create object of class
		2. To initialize data member/variable
		

Types of Constructor
	1. Default Constructor
	2. User defined Constructor
	

	1. Default Constructor
		If Constructor is not declared in java class then at the time of compilation compiler will provide Constructor for the class
		If programmer has declared the constructor in the class then compiler will not provided default Constructor.
		The Constructor provided by compiler at the time of compilation is known as Default Constructor

	2. User defined Constructor
		If programmer is declaring constructor in java class then it is considered to be as User defined constructor.
		User defined Constructor are classified into 2 types
			1. Without/zero parameter constructor
				// example-without parameter constructor --eg. addition
      			2. With parameter constructor
				// example-with parameter constructor- only 1 constructor -- eg. addidtion
				// example-with parameter constructor- multiple constructor -- eg. addition
Use of Static and non static:
Where to use static and where to use non static.
When we have requirement like all object can contain different information then we use non static 
And 
When we have condition like all object have same information then we use static.
static variable & static method is belong to the class it’s self & there values are shared among all the instance of class and initialized only once when class is loaded. And When we have 


•	Use static variables and methods when you want to have a shared value or behavior across all instances of a class, or when the value/behavior does not depend on any specific instance.
•	Use non-static variables and methods when you want each instance of a class to have its own separate values or behaviors, or when the value/behavior depends on a specific instance.
In summary, static is used for shared values/behaviors, while non-static is used for instance-specific values/behaviors.

We can gave information to non static global variables by creating object first in main method then ObjectName.VariableName= Value or information that we want give them
Like
ClassName ObjectName= new ClassName();
ObjectName.VariableName=Value which we want to provide;
Like 
Emp e1= new Emp();
E1.empName=”Rahaul”;
And also we can give value to static global variable by direct calling via ClassName.VaribaleName=Value which want to give;
ClassName.VariableName=Value we want enter;
Like 
Emp.empCEOName=”xyz”;
We use non static when we have to give different information to every object every time.
We use Static when we have to use same information for all variable/object which we provide latest value to Static variable it store that value in all previous declared variables/objects also they have different values but also we get value only which give in latest to that variable/object.
Static maintain latest information in all object which give currently/ recently it directly update it to all previous values.
But when we use  non static when there is condition for every object it will store different information every time.
When we have requirement like all object can contain different information then we use non static 
And 
When we have condition like all object have same information then we use static.
static variable & static method is belong to the class it’s self & there values are shared among all the instance of class and initialized only once when class is loaded. And When we have 

what is Object?
In real time all things are objects 
Object is nothing but instance of class having state and behaviour. Where state tell what data or information it has and behaviour states that what object will do by using information it has.  Where state  stands for variable and behaviour stands for methods. Objects allow you to organize and work with data in a structured way, making your code more organized and reusable. They help you model and represent things like people, cars, or any other entity in your program.
Characteristics of objects are:
1. State
2. Behaviour
All object have two characteristics state and behaviour.
1.	State tells use how the object looks or what properties it has
State means what content or information are present in that object.
2.	Behaviour tell us what the object does
Tell us what object do by using information present in it.

eg. Marker Pen
state- colour, size, price, weight
behaviour- write, throw

eg. Car
state: What the objects have:  Speed,Gear, Direction, Fuel level,Engine temperature
Behaviors: Change Gear, Go faster/slower,Go in reverse, Stop, Shut-off


Student:
State: what the objects have, Student have a first name, last name, age, etc
Behavior: what the objects do, Student attend a course "Software testing"


In the filed of java each and everything is consider to be as object.
Object is copy of class  which is having state & behaviour.
where state stands for variable(data member) & behaviour stands for methods(member functions).
Object oriented programming system (Oops)
 Java programming language is very popular in software industry because of Oops concept. 
Oops concept provides 5 important pillars / principles for the language they are:
1)	Inheritance 
2)	Polymorphism 
3)	Encapsulation 
4)	Interface 
5)	Abstraction 
All depends on non-static methods so always we have to create object first then we can access. 
1.	Inheritance:
Suppose one Class(This class is Called as parent Class)  have some properties or methods to use that properties or methods of first Class into second class also have its own properties or methods to call or use first class properties in second class we use extends  keyword by using this we can get properties of first Class into second Class but we cant see it but we can use it by creating object of second or current class where we are accessing the properties of both class is called child class or sub class
•	One class access of properties of another class with help of extends keyword its called as inheritance 
•	The class from which we accessing the properties or methods is called as supper class / base class/ parent class.
•	The Class where we are delivering the properties of parent Class is called as sub Class / Child Class.

Syntax of inheritance 

public		 class	 Son		 extends		 Father 
					
				sub Class/	keyword 		Super Class
				child Class	for inheritance   	Parent Class

public class sub/child class extends super Class /parent Class
sub Class accessing properties of supper Class l parents Class By using extends keyword.
When we call 
public class Son extends Father 
then in this case from father class  or super class we can copy all properties available in father class into Son Class or sub Class but we cant see them its internally available in sub class but for now its not visible they are visible only when we create object of sub class i.e. Son Class after creating object of sub class i.e. son then we can use properties of parent Class.
Child class also called as derived class.
Inheritance  is classified into 4 types:
		1. Single level Inheritance 
		2. Multilevel Inheritance  
		3. Multiple Inheritance
		4. hierarchical 

 

	It is one of the Oops principle where one class acquires properties of 
	another class with the help of 'extends' keywords is called Inheritance.

	The class from where properties are acquiring/inheriting is called super/base/parent class.

	The class too where properties are inherited/delivered is called sub/child class.

	Inheritance takes place between 2 or more than 2 classes.

	Inheritance  is classified into 4 types:
		1. Single level Inheritance 
		2. Multilevel Inheritance  
		3. Multiple Inheritance
		4. hierarchical 
 
	
1. Singlelevel Inheritance:
	It is a operation where inheritance takes place between 2 classes.
	To perform single level inheritance only 2 classes are mandatory.
We can’t perform inheritance in one class. We need minimum two classes for to perform inheritance.
When there is only two classes are available to perform inheritance is called single level inheritance.
We can perform single level in heritance in support class. (third class where we only call the properties sub class and parents class it don’t contain any method main method only and object of sub class created here ).




2. Multilevel Inheritance:
	Multilevel Inheritance takes place between 3 or more than 3 classes.

	In Multilevel Inheritance 1 sub class acquires properties of another super class &
	that class acquires properties of its another super class & phenomenon continuous.




 
Object Class:
Object Class is always present in each and every sub Class and properties of object class automatically inherited in sub Class while Creating object of sub Class. Properties of object class available in all sub class by default.
When ever we create sub class in java object class is always present in Class and properties of object class is directly inherited to sub Class without we manually inherited subclass extends object class its perform internally by default. And we cant stop it entering properties in subclass.
*Object class is the supper most Class in java.
Whenever we create Class properties of object Class is copies into that class.
Object Class is readymade class in java or inbuild Class in java and properties of object is automatically copied or inherited in each and every subclass.	
3. Multiple inheritance :
One sub class accruing properties of two supper classes at same time is known as multiple inheritance.
In java we cant perform multiple inheritance by using Classes.

While Calling  demo1 and demo2 both have same features of object Class then here confusion get created and this confusion is known as Diamond Ambiguity Problem because its Dimond Shape is Created , ambiguity means Confusion because two supper Class acquiring properties of one supper Class which is object and both supper Class have same properties of object class.
We can  perform multiple inheritance by using interface.	

4. Hierarchical :
multiple sub  Classes can acquires properties of one supper class is known as Hierarchical inheritance.
We can access properties of supper Class in sub Class by creating object of sub class and extends key word in class to connect sub class and parents Class.
By creating object of multiple Class We can access properties of sub class and supper class.
Note: Object Class is super most class in java
Java is platform independent language.

3. Multiple Inheritance:
	1 subclass acquiring properties of 2 super classes at the same time is known as Multiple Inheritance.
	Java doesn't support Multiple Inheritance using class because of "dimond ambiguity" problem.

	Note: object class is the super most class in java
	
	By using interface we can achieve Multiple Inheritance.

4. Hirarchicle Inheritance: 
	multiple sub classes can acquire properties of 1 super class is known as hirarchicle Inheritance.

Access specifiers:
Access specifiers are use to represent scope of members of class(variables , methods ,constructor).
	In java Access specifiers are classified into 4 types
	
	1. private
	2. default 
	3. protected
	4. public

1.	private: 
If we declare any member of class as private then scope of that member remains only within the class
		    It can't be access from other classes.

Private access specifiers are only use in class where we declare them and out side of that class we cant access or use it. In any situation like if we create object or perform inheritance also then also we can’t access private member in other class.
 We cant use private specifiers before class we just use access specifiers before Class member within Class  body only. Class members are variables, methods and constructors.

2.	default: 
If you declare any member of class as default then scope of that member remains only within the package
		    It can't be access from other packages.
		    There is no keyword to represent default access specifier.
If we declare member of class default then scope of class remains within only packages means Classes which are available in packages we can access default members. But from different package of same project we cant access default members of class. 
There is no key word to specify the default.
When we use different package class then import is show before the name  of different package ClassName only like

import 		packageName.ClassName 
import		diffrentpakage   Classname in
key word	name		different package

if we try to access form different package class it show error class members are not visible change visibility if we perform inheritance in default access specifiers class member then also its not accessible in different package class.
	
3.protected:
 If you declare any member of class as protected then scope of that member remains only within the package
		    that class which is present outside the package can access it by one condition ie. inheritance operation 

default and protected are same but there is keyword available for protected. 
We can access the protected member of class in different package class by performing inheritance. We can access protected class member in different package by using extend key word. 
		

4. public: 
If you declare any member of class as public then scope of that member remains throught the project.
 
Abstract Class:
	A class declared with "abstract" keyword is called abstract class.


	an Abstract class is nothing but an incomplete class where programmer 
	can declare complete as well as incomplete methods in it.  
1.	complete method means method with declaration and method with definition
like
public void m1()   // method declaration 
{
System.out.println(“Running method m1”); // method definition 
}
in complete methods means method which having only declaration is present and definition is absent is called in complete method like
public void m3(); 	// only declaration and close with semicolon 
it give error we have to use 
abstract key word in front of incomplete class and incomplete method also
like 
abstract public void m3(); // is syntax of abstract method or incomplete method
abstract public class ClassName // is syntax of abstract class


if method is incomplete then this method is called as abstract method we have to use abstract key word in front of method.
To show class incomplete the we have to use abstract keyword in front of class also 
Like 

abstract public class ClassName

we cant create object of abstract class.
Because if all the class features are 100% complete until then we cant access that class.

/* why we use abstract class ? 
While developing application all important function are complete first and the function which we needed in future is also mentioned here but we cant gave definition to that methods  or function for now we will provide values to them in future when needed. */


	programmer can declare incomplete methods as abstract method, by declaring keyword
	called "abstract" in front of method.

	we can't create object of abstract class, to create object of abstract class we need 
	to make use of concrete class.

We cant use abstract keywords with static or static method can never be abstract.
Concrete class: 
	A class which provides definitions for all the incomplete methods which are
	present in abstract class with the help of extends keywords is called concrete class.
 
To provide definition to abstract class incomplete methods we have to extend abstract class to class where we providing values or definition to incomplete method that class is called as concrete class.
Like
public class ClassName extend abstract ClassName

		Concrete 
		Class

In this case all properties or features are inherited or delivered in concrete class it include all complete and incomplete methods also we can provide definition to abstract method.

Until we provide definition to all incomplete method until its show error 
We don’t need to provide definition to complete method.
There is no keyword for concrete class to use before class.
We can create object of concrete class.



	can 1 Abstract Class extends another Abstract Class ?  yes
Interface:
In interference there is all incomplete methods in interface. In abstract there is combination of complete and incomplete methods. We are declaring all incomplete methods then we use interface.
Syntax of interface is:
Pubic interface interfacename
{
// interface body
}
In interface we declare only 100% incomplete methods or abstract methods like.
{
abstract public void m1(); // incomplete method
abstract public void m2();// incomplete method
}
Interface have its own features. 
(but abstract class and normal class don’t have there own features)
Which are
1)	methods declared inside Interface are by default public and abstract, means we don’t need to use public and abstract in front of method its by default added there we declare methods in interface is
void m1();// abstract public void m1(); abstract public is available there by default 
2)	data members  /  variables declared inside interface are by default static and final. Means variables we declared in interface is by default is static final variable means we cant change the value of variables by reinitializing it.
3)	Constructor concept is not present inside interface. But  constructor is present  class but not in interface. 
4)	We cant create object of interface like abstract class because here also are incomplete methods are present in interface.
Like abstract class to create object of abstract class we want use of concrete class by using extend key we provide definition to incomplete methods.
Like that 
5)	To create object of interface program we need to create implementation class by using implements keyword in implementation class we provide values to all incomplete methods.
Syntax of implementation class is
public class ClassName implements interfaceName 
		keyword
by using implementation we copied all methods in implementation class and we provide definition in implementation class. 
By creating object we can run thee methods object of implementation class.
6)	Interface support multiple inheritance. We cant perform multiple inheritance by using class due to diamond ambiguity problem.
Multiple inheritance means one implementation class implements properties of two supper interface at same time by using implements keyword. 
In inheritance there no any diamond ambiguity problem. Because interface don’t have any supper class like object class which available in all java class. Here no confusion is occurred in multiple inheritance.
Multiple inheritance syntax
public class implementation  implements interfaceName1,interfaceName2
Note:
Interface 
can 1 interface extends another interface? yes
can 1 class extends another class?    yes
can 1 interface implements another interface? No


It is one of the oops principle.
It is pure 100% abstract in nature.
Interface is use to declare only incomplete methods in it.

Features of Interface:
1. methods declared inside Interface are by default public & abstract.
2. Data Members/variable declared inside Interface are by default static and final.
3. Constructor concept in not present inside Interface.
4. Object of Interface can't be created.
5. To create object of Interface programmer need to make use of Implementation class using implements keyword.
6. Interface support multiple inheritance.

Implementation class:
A class which provides definitions for all the incomplete methods which are
present in interface with the help of "implements" keyword is called Implementation class.

Note:
can 1 interface extends another interface? yes
can 1 class extends another class?    yes
can 1 interface implements another interface? No


 
JVM have different types of memories
JVM memories is divided into four block
diff types of JVM memories:
1. Heap area 
2. Static pool area
3. method area 
4. stack
1)  whenever we declare non-static method like 
Public void m1() // declaration of non static
Then declaration of non static  method is stored in heap area
2) when we declare static method like 
Public static void m2() // declaration of static method
then  declaration of static method is stored in static pool area of JVM.
3)and definition of static and non-static methods are stored in methods area.
Like 
Public void m1() // declaration of non-static
{
System.out.println(“hello”); // definition of non-static method
}
Public static void  m2() // definition of non-static method
{
System.out.println(“Saurav); // definition of static method
}

4)stack decide  the execution flow of methods stack have main method by default because compiler start searching for main method from stack if class have main method then execution is continue or if not present then JMP throw error that main method is not found.
Compile time 
Runtime
Compile time means where we writing code and if we make mistake then compiler show error called compiler time error before execution or running code because here compiler continuously scanning is programmer entering all valid code which are acceptable in java.
•	Compile time refers to the phase when your source code is converted into executable code (usually bytecode in Java) by the compiler.
•	During compile time, the compiler checks the syntax and structure of your code, identifies any syntax errors or logical issues, and generates the corresponding executable code if everything is correct.
•	If there are any errors or issues found during compilation, the compiler produces error messages that need to be resolved before successfully compiling the code.
•	Examples of compile-time errors include syntax errors, missing semicolons, undeclared variables, or using incompatible data types.

Run time means  when we run the program is called runtime or execution time. Like suppose we are performing  division 
Int a= 10;
Int b= 0;
Int div =10/0;
Here after when we run this cod then compiler throw error like that its arithmetic exception error.
•	Any errors or issues that occur during the execution of the program are called runtime errors or exceptions.
•	Runtime errors may occur due to various reasons, such as accessing an invalid memory location, dividing by zero, or encountering unexpected input data.
•	Examples of runtime errors include NullPointerExceptions, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions, or ArithmeticExceptions.
Examples of runtime errors include accessing invalid memory or dividing by zero.



1. Heap area--> non-static method declaration
2. Static pool area--> static method declaration
3. method area --> static & non-static method defination
4. stack --> main()--> method execution flow


Compiletime  --->
Runtime/Executiontime -->

 
While we writing methods then this divided into 4 block to execute code we need bind together like at compilation time or runtime for this we have two types of polymorphism.
Polymorphism:
Its is one of oops principle where one object showing different behaviour at different stages of life cycle. 
Polymorphism is an Latin word where poly  stand for  Many  and morphism stands for forms
in java polymorphism is classified into two types 
1.	Compile time Polymorphism 
2.	Runtime polymorphism 
/* 1.  compile time polymorphism :
When declaration and definition of methods which are divided int different block and they there binding at compile time before running program is called compile time polymorphism.
2.  run time polymorphism :
 When declaration and definition of methods which are binding after execution or program run then its called as runtime polymorphism */
1.	Compile time polymorphism :
In  compile time polymorphism method declaration is going to get bind to its definition at compilation time, based on the arguments / inputs / parameters is known as compile time polymorphism.
As binding takes during compilation time only , so its also known as early binding.
Method overloading is examples of compile time polymorphism.
Method overloading : 
Declaring multiple method with a same method name with different parameters / arguments / inputs in same class is called method overloading. 
We can declare n numbers of methods with same method name but with different parameters in same class.

In method overloading declaration and definition are binding at compilation time.
When we call method now have methods with same names so we have to give inputs like we give input like 2 integer then complier will run 2 int parameters method. Compiler will bind methods depend on the parameters. 
2.Runtime polymorphism: 
In runtime polymorphism method declaration is going to be binds with its definition at runtime/execution time, based on object creation is known as runtime polymorphism.
As binding take place during the runtime / execution time so its also known as late binding.
 Method Overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism.
Method overriding :
 We can make changes when we extends properties from super class to sub class we have properties of father and son we can extends properties of father into son  then in son class we can change properties of method which are extends in sub class  means we can change definition of methods. Like
// father class
Public void car();
{
System.out.println(“BMW”);
}
// son 
Public void car()
{
System.out.println(“kia”);
}
In this way
When we create object of super class then compiler will bind definition of and declaration of superclass 
And 
When we create object of sub class then compiler will bind declaration and definition of sub class at runtime.
Its depend on  object mean for which class we creating object.



 	It is one of the OOPs principle where one object showing diffrent behaviour at diffrent stages of life cycle.
	Polymorphism is an latin word where poly stand for many & morphism stands for forms.
	In java Polymorphism is classified into 2 types:
		1. Compiletime Polymorphism
		2. Runtime Polymorphism
 

1. Compiletime Polymorphism:
	In Compiletime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to its defination at compilation time,
	based on argument/input/parameter is known as compiletime Polymorphism.

	As binding takes during compilation time only, so it is also known as early binding.

	//once binding is done, again rebinding can't be done, so it is called static binding.

	Method overloading is an example of compiletime Polymorphism.


2. Runtime Polymorphism:
	In Runtime Polymorphism method declaration is going to get binded to its defination at Runtime/execution time,
	based on object creation is known as runtime Polymorphism.

	As binding takes during Runtime/execution time, so it is also known as late binding.

	//once binding is done, again rebinding can be done, so it is called dynamic binding.

	Method overriding is an example of Runtime Polymorphism.


Method overloading: 
		Declaring multiple method with same method name but with diffrent argument/parameter/inputs in a same class is called 
		method overloading

Method overriding: 
		Acquiring super class method into sub class with the help of extends keyword & changing implementaion/defination
		according to subclass specification is called method overriding

Casting:
Meaning of casting is converting one types of information into another is called casting.
In java 2 types :
1.	Primitive casting 
2.	Non- primitive casting
1.	Primitive casting: 
means converting one data type of information into another data type is called primitive casting like converting int type of data int to long float to double etc.
Primitive casting is classified into 3 types.
1)	Implicit casting 
2)	Explicit casting 
3)	Boolean casting
1.  implicit casting :
When we converting lower data type information into higher data types of information is  called as implicit casting and its also called as winding casting where memory size goes increasing 
Like int value a to long a float a to double like that
Means we are converting 4byte information int 8 byte as memory size of int is 4byte and long is 8 byte. when we are converting lower size of data into higher then is called as implicit casting.
E.g.
int a= 5; // memory size of int is 4 byte
System.out.println(a); / /5 value of a
long b=a; // here we assigning value of int a to long b value of a is storing in long b , 
Syso(b) / / 5 long memory size value of long is 8bytes.
2. explicit casting :
Converting higher data type information into lower data types information is called explicit casting. Explicit casting is also called as narrow casting. When we are copying data from higher memory size into lower memory size so there is possibility of data loss but also some time data loss not is  happen its not mandatory.
E.g.
double b = 2.5 // memory size of double is 8 bytes
syso(b) //2.5 value of double
float a= (float)b
while we performing explicit conversion is higher to lower the we cant directly assign higher value to lower value first we have convert higher value into lower like (float)b then this (float) b value is stored in float a.(on which data we want to convert it)
syso (a) // 2.5
3.  Boolean casting:
Boolean casting is considered to be incompatible casting type, because Boolean data type is unique data type where information is already predeclared inside it. We can’t convert Boolean to int Boolean to float like this.
Boolean values are fix which are either true or false 
Boolean str = true 
B. non primitive Casting:
 Converting one type of class into another type of class is called non primitive casting.
Non primitive casting is classified into two types:
1)	UP Casting 
2)	Down Casting
1. Up Casting 
Means assigning subclass properties into super class is called upcasting.
Before performing up casting inheritance is mandatory. If we don’t perform inheritance between super class to sub class then up casting is not possible.
In up casting all the properties which are inherited to sub class only that properties of super class is return whether its modified or override properties as its. All properties of super class is only return to super form sub class properties of sub class is not inherited in supper class.
We have to cerate object of sub class with reference to supper class
When we are performing up casting there is formula.
Syntax of up casting.
superClassName objectName= new subClassName();
here new key word creating blank object.
subClassName() is constructor which copy all data in sup class in into object
superClassNAme when we give as super class as data type super class means supper class only access the properties of supper class which extend in subclass.
 After performing inheritance the property the properties which are present is super class comes into subclass in sub class we can declare new properties also.
At the time of up casting operation the properties which are inherited from super class are only eligible for up casting operation the new properties or won properties of sub class are not eligible for up casting.
Father f= new Son();
		f.home();
		f.bankbalance();
2. Down Casting :
Assigning super class properties into sub class is called down Casting.
Before performing down casting 1st we need to perform upcasting.
Repeated inheritance is not possible inheritance take place (between super class to sub clas) only once.
We have to convert super class object into sub class and we have to assign it to sub class object.
	Son s=(Son)f;
	s.bike();
s.bankbalance();

 

	Converting one type of information into another type is called casting
	In java casting is classified into 2 types:
		1. Primitive casting
		2. Non-primitive casting
	
1. Primitive-casting:
	Converting one data type of information into another data type is called Primitive-casting
	primitive-casting is classified into 3 types:
		1. implicit casting
		2. explicit casting
		3. boolean casting

	1. implicit casting:
		Converting lower data type info into higher data type info is called implicit casting.
		implicit casting is also called widning casting, where memory size goes on incresing,
		eg.   
			int a=5     // (memory size of int is 4 byte)
			sop(a)       // 5
			long b = a    //(memory size of long is 8 byte)
			sop(b)          //5

	2. explicit casting:
		converting higher data type info into lower data type info is called explicit casting.
		explicit casting is also called narrowing casting, where memory size goes on decresing.
		In explicit casting data loss takes place
		eg.   
			double b = 2.5    //(memory size of double is 8 byte)
			sop(b)          //2.5
			float a= (float)b    // (memory size of int 4 byte)
			sop(a)           //2.5

	3. boolean cassting:
		boolean casting is considered to be incompatible casting type, because boolean data type is unique type of data type
		where information is already predeclared inside it.

		boolean str = true
		

2. Non-Primitive casting
	Converting one type of class into another type of class is called non-primitive casting.
	non-primitive is classified into 2 types:
             ** 1. Up casting
	        2. Down casting
		
	1. Up casting:
		Assigning subclass property into superclass is called upcasting.
		before performing upcasting 1st we need to perform inheritance operation.

		after performing inheritance, the property which are present inside superclass comes into subclass
		In the subclass programer can declare new properties.

		At the time of upcasting operation the properties which are inherited from superclass are only eligible for the upcasting operation.
		The new property which were declared inside subclass are not eligible for upcasting operation.

	2. down casting:
		Assigning superclass property into subclass is called downcasting.
		before performing downcasting 1st we need to perform upcasting.
package Casting;
Generalization: 
When  we have situation like we have 3 implementation class and all have common features but use or facilities are different from one another  then we declare that common features in one supper interface and we provide value to different different  implementation class by performing implementation between interface and implementation class. And the interface where we declare common features is called super interface and generalization file. And in implementation class we can use common features form interface and provide values them and also define and declare unique features which only available for that particular class. Generalization can be perform by using class and abstract class but in java only interface are recommended. Suppose we have   implementation classes but there no common features available then we cant perform generalization like jio sim and bank.
 
 
Identifying all subclass that all common features they have and declaring common features or properties into supper interface and providing implementation or definition to them according to subclass specification is called generalization.

Generalization file means where we declaring common features or properties of sub call. Generalization file can be normal class or abstract class but only interface are recommended.
Suppose there is three sim card companies like jio, airtel , VI all have same features  like SMS, audio Calling, data but all they are giving some different limits have same features  but different limit and all have there unique features also in generalization on common features declaration are implements by interface to implementation class in implementation class we can give there different definition to declaration and also declare unique features also.
Extracting all the important common properties from sub class & declaring it in super class(ie. super interface) & providing 
	implementation/defination according to subclass specification is called Generalization.
 

	generalization file can be normal java class or abstract class or Interface, but only Interface is recommonded.

Abstraction:
It one of oops principle in java 
Which hides the implementation of code and providing only functionality to end users is called abstraction 
Suppose we are using application or web site we can only see the functionality which available there in UI or frontend and we can perform our operation by using it but we cant see the codes which are running at back end.
	The scenario of Abstraction is "if customer is visiting or making use of any application, 
	then he should utilize functionality only & he should not feel any backend code processing"

This Keyword:
We can give same variable name in class by declaring globally and locally 
When we have same local variable name and global variable name in same class to call global variable name then we use this keyword
Like suppose we have
int a=10; //global variable which declare and intialise out side method 
public void m1()
{
int a=20; // local variable declared inside method
System.out.println(a);
}
When we run the printing statement the we get value of a= 20 i.e. local variable value printing statement always the value first which declared in it but if want call or print value of a=10 i.e. global variable then we use this keyword like
int a=10; //global variable which declare and initialise out side method 
public void m1()
{
int a=20; // local variable declare inside method
System.out.println(this.a); 
}
Now we can get value of a=10 
When we have same local variable name and global variable name in same class to call global variable name then we use this keyword.

In Java, the "this" and "super" keywords are used to refer to different elements within a class hierarchy:
1.	"this" Keyword:
•	"this" refers to the current instance of a class.
•	It is used to access or refer to the members (variables, methods, constructors) of the current object.
•	It is particularly useful when there is a need to differentiate between instance variables and parameters/local variables with the same name.
•	"this" can be used to invoke constructors, call other methods within the same class, or access instance variables or methods.
"this" keyword:
•	Differentiate between instance variables and local variables with the same name.
•	Invoke one constructor from another constructor in the same class.
•	Access instance variables or methods of the current object.

The "this" keyword is only applicable within non-static methods, constructors, or instance initialization blocks, where there is an object instance that the keyword can refer to.

Can we use this keyword in main method?
No, you cannot use the "this" keyword in the main method of a Java program. The "this" keyword is used to refer to the current instance of a class, but the main method is a static method, which means it belongs to the class itself rather than any specific instance.
Super Keyword:
To call the global variable of super class then we use super keyword.
 Suppose we have one super class and sub class and we perform inheritance between two classes then properties of super class is copied or extended in sub class and we have global variable of super class and global variable of sub class is same then to call the value of super class global variable then we use Super keyword.
super" Keyword:
•	"super" refers to the superclass (parent class) of a subclass.
•	It is used to access or invoke members (variables, methods, constructors) of the superclass.
•	"super" is commonly used to invoke the superclass constructor or to access overridden methods or variables in the superclass.
•	It is helpful when there is a need to explicitly refer to the superclass's implementation of a method or to access superclass-specific members.
•	"super" keyword:
•	Invoke the superclass constructor from a subclass constructor.
•	Access superclass methods or variables that have been overridden in the subclass.
•	Access superclass-specific members that are not present in the subclass.
Both "this" and "super" are essential in Java's object-oriented programming to handle instances, inheritance, and class hierarchies effectively.

•	"this" refers to the current instance of a class. It is used to access or refer to the members of the current object.
•	"super" refers to the superclass (parent class) of a subclass. It is used to access or invoke members of the superclass.
In summary, "this" is for accessing current object members, and "super" is for accessing superclass members

Can we use super keyword in main method?
No, you cannot use the "super" keyword in the main method of a Java program. The main method is static and not associated with any particular instance, so there is no superclass to refer to. The "super" keyword is used to access superclass members from within a subclass and is typically used in non-static methods or constructors of the subclass.
Patterns:
When have to print patterns the we use for loop
We have to calculate the total number of rows if want print * in following manner then
*
*
*
*
Then condition is  that
For(int i=1; i<=I;i++)
{
System.out.println(“*”);
}
We use println if we want every time after execution of one  condition complete then cursor move to on next line then we use println
Suppose  we have condition to print ***** like this then
Conditio for that is 
for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
{
System.out.print(“*”);
}
Now we use print means we get output on same line because in print cursor is not move to next time after execution of one condition 

Suppose we have condition like we have to print
****
****
Like that then this time we have to calculate the rows and column. Then use for loop for row we use outer for loop which can run two time because its two row available there. And we use inner for loop for column now here is 4 column then this inner for loop run four time we have to mention variable of inner loop is different always. 
 So for condition is like that 

for(int i=1;i<=2;i++)  // outer for loop for row
{
for(int j=1;i<=4;i++); // inner loop for column
{
System.out.print(“*”);

}
System.out.println(); // blank println statement for new line after execution of inner loop
Here exaction start from outer loop first compiler check starting number that is int i= 1 then it check that I value with end condition that is i<=2 now value of I is less than 2 then condition get true and compiler inter in outer loop body and start execution of inner for loop here it check that starting value that is int j=1 and check j value with condition i.e. j<=4 and for now value of j is 1 which is less than equal to 4 condition get true then compiler enter in inner loop body and then run piniting statement and print value * and after that cursor is not move to next line because we use print statement after execution compiler check 3rd parameter or i.e. increment operation and perform increment by 1 then value of j is increment by 1 and we get j=2 again condition is true again compiler print value * this process is repeated until condition get false. When execution of inner loop get stop the compiler run the empty println statement and move curser to the next line then it comes to outer loop and perform increment operation i.e. i=2 condition is true then again it get into inner loop and perform loop and we get output like 
****
****

Arrays :
When we have too much data of same data types and we want store it together then int this case  we use arrays .
Suppose we have roll no of 50 student in that case we have to declare 50 integer variable. But if use  arrays then we can store many data of same type in it by creating object of array . So for to store integer value for 50 roll no then we have to create integer array and by creating object of that array when can store value in that same object. 
Arrays is object in which we store many data of same type and each data is stored in different index.

Arrays declaration 
To declare array there is syntax 

Datatype [] objectName = new Datatype[size of index]; // array declaration 

int [] ar=new int[5];

datatype specify that which type of arrays is
[] is array symbol  use to specify that we declaring array
ObjectName is name of object of array it can be any thing means we can use any name for object.
New keyword is creating new blank object and divide object in to number of partition the capacity of array which we provide in [].
Datatype[size of index] we have to specify datatype again with [] arrays sign in that we to specify  range of index or size of index that how much data we want store it initially.

Arrays index is always start with 0
And end index is find out there is formula for that is length-1/ capacity-1/size-1 

Suppose we specify capacity of 10 then our starting index is always 0 and end index is length-1 i.e. 9
Here we specify that capacity is 5 i.e.
int [5] for this here is index for this like
	0		1			2			3		4
105	106	108	107	109

Arrays initialisation 
After declaring arrays we have to initialise it or we have to provide value for arrays. To initialise array we have to provide value to each index. We have to initialize index like
Objectname[index value] =information;
ar[0]=105; // 0 is starting index and here we provide int value for 0 which is starting index
Value which provide on right hand side is stored in arrays 0 index of starting index.
	
	ar=106;  	// 106 is stored in second index i.e. 1 
ar=108;  
ar=107;  
ar=109;  

we provide value to all 5 index.

if we provide value to index which we specify the capacity only if we provide value to the index which is not specify then it throw error that index out of bounds for length  at arrays.
Array is not present so we cant provide value that index.

Arrays Uasage:
 Array which we initialise and we want print it then we have use printing statement and specify the  objectname with index value then we can print that value
Like 
Sysetm.out.println(ar[3]); // it will print the value which stored at third index i.e. 107

Suppose if want to check the capacity of array or size or length of array then we have to use 
arrayobjectName.lengnth  
System.out.println(ar.length)// it wil print the length of array i.e 5

.length is attribute or variable which specify the length or capacity  of arrays.

To print all data in array we have to use for loop. (we can use any lop for to print all data in array.)
To print all data of array by using for loop in loop we have to mention the start index end index and increment of decrement on which order we want print that data.  
Like 
for (int i =0;i<=a.lengnth-1;i++)
{
System.out.println(ar.[0]);
}
Here we mention that i = 0 i.e. 0 is start index of array 
i<=a.length-1  here we specify end condition i.e. i <=formula for end index as we are printing    in increasing order 
i++ i.e. increment by one
and in printing statement we mention arrayobjectname.[i]; i i.e. index value which is starting for 0.
here compiler check value of i  i.e. 0 then it will check condition i.e. 0 is less than equal to 4 then compiler entered into loop body and execute printing statement here we give array object name i.e. ar[i] value of i  index 0 i.e. 0 as index 0 have value is 106 it will print value of index 0 then compiler check third parameter which is increment operation and its increment value of i which is 0 to 1 and again check the end condition that is 1 less than equal to 4 and again enter to loop body and execute the printing statement and now value of i is 1  and it will print index 1 value i.e 106 this loop continue until condition get false and stop execution. And we will print all value from 0 to 4 index .
  we can use any datatype in arrays 
we can declare int arrays, float arrays, double, string , char. Etc
we can print arrays value in reverse order also by using the decrement operation.
For this we have to give end index first and then start index.

Suppose if have condition like that we have data and we want print in it in ascending order and then in descending order but data which is given is not serial or not sorted then we have to sort data first.


In java here one inbuild for arrays we have to call that class importing that Arrays class to call that class we have mention when ever we call class from different package it get automatically imported in to class. 
Arrays // this inbuild class i.e. java.util


As we want to sort data here for that we Call  arrays class and then we call arrays class  static sort method. Sort method is static type.
Arrays.sort(arraysobjectname);
Arrays.sort(ar);

When we run this method then it will goes into arrays sort data in serial way it store smallest value to 0 index and highest value to last index mean small to large. When we run sort method then data present in our array is permanently shifted means smaller value is stored in 0 i.e. start index and highest value in last index i.e. length-1. As we sort data form small to large. We print it ascending and descending order also by using for loop and increment for ascending order and decrement for descending order.

We can sort numbers and string also.

we can provide  direct declaration & initialization in single step to arrays like variable.
Like 
int [] ar={400,200,100,200} ;
here we metion the data type i.e. int then array object name  and we provide values in cruelly braces and terminated with ; means  here we don’t specify array length and new keyword. Here values automatically stored into objects index invidiously mean one value in each index  like 
400 is stored at 0th index which is starting index
200 is 1st index 
300 is 2nd index
400 is 3rd index 

We can provide string values or any values directly also to arrays like
String [] ar={“Rahul”, “Ganesh” , “Mahesh” , “Suresh”}; / / as it is string values we have to 
Assign it into “ ”  double quotation marks 
	We have to give values in {} directly to arrays and we use “,” comma for separation.
When We have to cerate empty object and later we provide value to that object then we have to use new keyword but  when we providing values to object directly while creating object  then we provide in {} directly.
Signal dimensional Arrays:
When are storing data in single row in then is called single dimensional arrays.
	0		1			2		3			4
1	2	3	4	5

Like we are Storing  value to array from index  0 to 4 like 
Multi-dimensional arrays:
Arrays in which we are storing data inti multiple row and multiple column then is called multi-Dimensional array like matrix.
Suppose we  want store data like 
       		Column
		0	1	2
// row 0	10 	20 	30 
//  row 1 	40	 50	 60 
Here are two row’s and 3 column’s then we have to create array which called as Multi-Dimensional array. Because here we storing data in multiple row’s and multiple column’s.
To Create Multiple arrays there is syntax like:
Datatype []		 [] ar = 		new int		 [Number of row ] [Numbers of Column’s ];
	Arrays 		Arrays 		keyword 	we have to mention    we have to mention
	Symbol		Symbol				no. of row in[]		no. of column in[]
	For row		For Column 

Int [] [] ar = new int [2] [3]; // declaration of muti dimensional array
Now we have to initialize each row and column we have to provide for each row and column.
ar[0][0]=10;
ar[0][1]=20;
ar[0][2]=30;
ar[1][0]=40;
ar[1][1]=50;
ar[1][2]=60;

to print value of one of index we have to give printing statement like
System.out.println(ar[0][2]);	 // we get value of row 0 which is row 1 and column 2 which is column 3 i.e. 30

•	In multi-dimensional arrays if want to find length of array by using objectname.length  
then we   get only length/size of row we don’t get length/size of column. 
•	If we have data in table format then  value stored in row first and then columns means 
row comes first then columns.
Suppose if want to print all data in multi-dimensional arrays then we have use two for loop’s first loop i.e. outer loop for row and inner for loop for columns. Like
for (int i=0; i<=1;i++) // for loop for row i.e. 0 & 1 means two rows
{
for (int j=0;j<=2;i++) // for loop for column i.e. 0,1,2 means three column 
{
System.out.println(ar[i][j]);
}
System.out.println(); // blank printing statement for next like after execution completion of 1st  row
}
Here compiler check i  value i.e. zero with end number condition i.e. i<=1 here condition is true then compiler enter into first loop body and check j value with second parameter i.e. condition j<=2 Condition is true then compiler enter into 2nd loop body and execute printing statement and we get value of 10 i.e. row 0,column 0 then compiler check third parameter i.e. j++ and increment j value from 0 to 1 and check with the 2nd parameter i.e. condition j<=2 condition is true then compiler enter into 2nd loop body and execute printing statement and we will get value 20 i.e. value of row 0 and column 1 then compiler check 3rd parameter i.e. j++ and increment value of j i.e. 1 to 2 and check current j value with 2nd parameter i.e. end number condition i.e. j<=2 conditions is true compiler enters into 2nd loop body and execute printing statement and we get value 30 i.e value of row 0 and column 2 and then compiler check 3rd parameter and increment j value 2 to 3 and check with 2nd parameter i.e. end condition j<=2 which false and inner loop get terminated then complier execute blank printing statement and increment i  value i.e. 0 to 1 and check with second parameter i.e. end condition i<=1 which true and then compiler enter into fist loop body and then check second loop check j vale and process continue then we get all value of rows and column.
We can directly pass the value of to multiple arrays also. Like 
int[] [] ar={{10,20,30},{40,50,60}};
for this we have to use separate curly braces  within curly braces  and in each curly braces we can enter value of row and columns.
Limitation of Arrays :
There are two limitations in arrays 
1.	Array have fix size means when are declare arrays we have to mention size of array  while creating array. Suppose if we create arrays with size of 5 then this arrays is storing data form index 0 to 4 but if we want to store data of 6 element  or 7 then in between program we cant store that values because in arrays we can only store value in between length out of length values are not allowed. We have to mention size of array initially while creating arrays.
2.	Arrays is homogeneous is nature. Means  we cant data or store different type of data suppose if its int array then we cant store String data in in it.
Array is object which have many indexes and arrays index is always start with zero.
Array is data structure use to store the collection of information
To over comes the limitation of arrays there is another topic which called is collection. 
 
How to sort multidimensional  array?
 // sort multidimetion array
			// a means all elements in array 
			// a-> a[0] sort all element for starting 
			Arrays.sort(ar,Comparator.comparingInt(a->a[0]));
			
			for(int [] sum:ar)
			{
				System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sum));
			}
String Class:
1.	String is non primitive data type, memory size of string  is not fixed .
2.	String is use to store collection of characters means we can store any type of value in string like combination of number, alphabets means we can store combination of multiple data type in string by assign this information into “” double quotation marks.
3.	String is a inbuild / ready made class present inside “Java.lang” package. As string is non primitive data type along this its inbuild class in java like object class string is inbuild class there are many functions available in string class. It is present when we install java on our computer then there is one java project present internally with many inbuild packages and classes we have one java project in that project there is lang names package is there in this package string class is present.
4.	String Class is final class it cant be inherited to other Classes. Final means we cant change the values of final variable because that values are converted to constant  by performing reinitialization we cant change values of final variable  same  as we also cant change values in final  class also. Means if we declare class as final by using final keyword then in this case we cant perform inheritance with that class with other class as we know that we change the values of supper class into sub class after inheritance but string is final class means we cant perform inheritance with other class. in final class if we declare properties in final class then we cant change it that properties because of this it not allow for inheritance it show error that remove final modifier of class.
But we can Use properties of string Class By creating object of string Class But we Can’t extends string class into other class
Syntax of final class is :
final public class ClassName
5.	At the time of string declaration , initialization , object creation takes place.  When we declare string or initialize string that time object of string created automatically.
String s1; // only declaration of string 
If we only declare string then also object of string is get created.
Suppose if perform declaration and initialization then also object of string is get created. 
Like 
String s2=”ab”; // declaration plus initialization string 
In both case object of string is get created.
6.	String object are immutable in nature / can’t be change.  Means suppose if we create object of string then we cant change it.
Suppose if we declare string 
String s3 = ” ab ” ; 
 Here we declared string now s3 object is get created and value ab is get stored in s3.
Whenever we print object s3 then it will print s3 object value i.e. ab
Suppose if want to add some other information with s3 i.e. object add cd into s3 then in this case we provide this values like
s3=s3+”cd”; // s3 have previous information i.e. ab and we also add cd into i.e. ab+cd
		now s3 have value abcd
here we are adding new information in to object s3 in this type of statement parameters  which are right hand side of = sing get execute first and then store i.e. s3 have value ab and we also adding cd then abcd get combine and  this value in left hand side variable or object.
As we give new value to s3 then here another copy of  object is get created and new information is get stored into it and previous object get discarded. 

If we create object of string then we cant change it and if we are reinitialize value of object or variable then it will create new copy of object and store that information to new copy of object and previous object get discarded. It does not change in existing object.

7.	Object creation of string can be done in two ways:
1.	Without suing new keyword 
2.	 Using new keyword
1.	Object creation using without using new Keyword
String s1=” xyz”;
Here object of string get created without using new key word.
2.	Object creation using new keyword
String s2= new String(“abc”); // here we have to assign values into constructor
Here abc is get stored into s2.
8.	String objects are going to get stored inside String pool area which is present inside the heap area. When we cerate object of string then it will get stored into String pool area which is present into heap area of JVM memories.
JVM have four memories are which are heap area, Static pool area, method area and stack.
In heap area there is String pool area is available in which object of string is get stored.
String Pool Area:
It is used to store string objects.
It is classified into two area:
1.	Constant Pool area
2.	Non-constant pool area
1. Constant pool area:
During object creation time if we don’t make use of new keyword then object creation take place inside constant pool area.
Like 
String s1=”abc”; // then this s1 object is stored in constant pool area
String s2= “abc”;
Suppose we cerate new object and provide same information then it refers to old object. We can refer 1000 variable to same object when the information is same.
When there is two object this different information then in this case two new object get created but when cerate two object but information same in that condition it refers to previous object it don’t create new object. 
Duplicate objects information is not allowed in constant pool area.
Memory allocation space save here because we cerate only object for same information and refers to different variable.
2. non-constant pool area:
When we cerate object by using new key word then object creation is takes place inside non- constant pool area. 
Like
String s4=new String(“abc”);// when we use new key by creating object then object is stored into 
non-constant pool area.
Duplicate objects information are allowed in non-constant pool area.
Suppose if we cerate object for same information then it will cerate new object every time 
Suppose if we create object for different information also  then it will create new object every time 

String 5= new String(“abc”);
String 6= new String(“XYZ”);
Memory wastage is possible by using non constant pool area. because here we creating different object for same information 
String class: 
	1. String is non-primitive data type, memory size is not fixed.
	2. String is use to store collection of characters.
	3. String is a inbuilt/ready made class present inside "java.lang" package.
	4. String class is final class can't be inherited to other classes.
	5. At the time of String declaration, initialization, object creation takes place.
	6. String objects are immutable in nature/can't be change.
	7. Object creation of String can be done in 2 ways:
		1. Without using new keyword
		2. Using new keyword
	8. String objects are going to get stored inside String pool area which is present inside heap area.
 
String pool area:
	It is use to store String objects.
	It is classified into 2 areas:
		1. Constant pool area
		2. Non-constant pool area.
 

1. Constant pool area:
	1. During object creation time if you don't make use of new keyword then 
		object creation takes place inside constant pool area.
 
	Duplicate objects info are not allowed inside constant pool area. 

2. non-constant pool area:

	2. During object creation time if you make use of new keyword then 
		object creation takes place inside non-constant pool area.
 
	Duplicate objects info are allowded inside non-constant pool area.
String Class Methods
Here we perform string related operations like find out length of string , convert string from lower case to upper, upper to lower, etc. by using String methods available in string class.
To use methods in string class we have to cerate object of string class then we can call the methods from string class.
Like 
String s1=”velocity”;
Whenever we declare or initialise the object of string is get created automatically.
In that object multiple slots are created for to store each character in single slot. Slots are get created on the basis of length of string. Here we declare 8 character so object s1  sis divided into 8 slots. Each character is store in separate slot.
String index is always  Starts with 0 and end index is length-1(length of string – 1).
1.	String Length method
Suppose if want count the length of string then there is method available in string class called length method which return the length of string. Here we count how many characters are present in string along with blank spaces.
Suppose have String value like 
String s1=”velocity”;
System.out.println(s1.length()) // here we are calling length method which is present in String class by 
			creating object of string i.e. s1. It will give output i.e. 8 
here we calling length method which is present in string class and returning int value means length or size of string.
Blanks spaces are also count space or store in one slot  in object. Suppose if we decalere String v locity then now length of string is 9 because blank space also get space in object as string value.
 If there is spaces are added in between string it return length of string along with white spaces or blank spaces.
In array class length is just attribute but in a String class length is present as a method 
2.	ToUppercase method
ToUpperCase method is used to convert string value into Upper Case. 
Suppose if want to convert string value into Upper case then we use ToUpperCase method which is available in String Class. like suppose we have string value like
String s1=”velocity”;
System.out.println(s1.ToUpperCase()); // here we are calling ToUpperCase now it Convert 
				String value which s present in s1 object into Upper 
				Case like VELOCITY by just creating copy of s1 object 
				Or string value.
here we are calling ToUpperCase now it Convert String value which s present in s1 object into Upper Case like VELOCITY by just creating copy of s1 object Or string value. It cant convert original value in upper for permanently because we use in printing method for only for this time it covert value of s1 into upper case by creating copy of string value.
If we want convert string value in Upper case for permanent then we have use we have to perform initialization in variable like 
s1=s1.ToUpperCase(); // here it convert data or value store in s1 into upper case and store 

					it into s1 again here now string value is converted to in to uppercase for permanently.

here it convert data or value store in s1 into upper case and store it into s1 again here now string value is converted to in to uppercase for permanently

3.	toLoweCase method
if we want to convert String value into lower case then we use toLoweCase.
Suppose we have string value like
String s2=”VELOCITY”;
System.out.println(s2.TolowerCase()); // here we use toLoweCase method now it convert string
				 Value into lowercase i.e. velocity 

Here as we use printing statement then is only convert string value into lower for temporary by creating copy of string value. this is not permanent change .
 If want change string value into lower case permanently then we have to perform reinitialization on object like
s2=s2.toLowerCase(); 
 here we are converting object value into lower case by using toLowerCase() it will convert object value or string value into lower case and again store into object now string value is permanently converted into lowercase 

4.	.  equals method 
when have to compare the data of two string then we use equals method which is available in String class. if values are same then it will return true if values are different then it will return false. Equals method is data\value and case sensitive also. This method check data and case if values are same but case are different then it return false. If both data and case are same then it returns true otherwise false.
suppose we want to compare data/value of two string then we use equals method suppose we have two string available like 
String s1=”velocity”;

String s2=”VELOCITY”;
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // here compiler check or compare data available in s1 and s2 Is 
		Same or not as equals method is data and case sensitive he get output false
Here we use equals method now compiler check or compare value of s1 with s2 if data/values  are same then it will return true or if values are not same then its return false. This method check data and case if values are same but case are different then it return false value. 

5.	equalsignoreCase
when we have to compare only string  data or values of two   ignoring case then we have method called as equalsignoreCase method if values of both string are same then it will return true otherwise false .
Suppose we want to compare two string value ignoring case then we use equalsingnoreCase like suppose we have two string values like 


String s1=”velocity”;

String s2=”VELOCITY”;
System.out.println(s1.equlasignoreCase(s2); // here we are comparing values of s1 and s2 by using
				 equalsignoreCase method means we only values
				not case then we get result true b’coz s1 and s2 have same value
here we are checking only values by ignoring case then we get result if values if same then compiler will return true otherwise false.

6.	Contains method
If want to check that one of the word is present in string value or not then we use contains method which is available in Sting class. in contains method it check word is present in string or not in anywhere in string if it present is returns true otherwise false. This method is case sensitive means if value is present in upper case and we are checking in it lower case then it will return false.

Suppose we have string like below and we want check that rahul is present of not. Then we check that like
String s3=”my name is rahul”; 
System.out.println(s3.contains(“rahul”)); // here we get output true because rahul is present 
				In s3.
7.  startsWith() );
When we want to check this particular word/ characters is present at starting of string or not then we use startWith() method. This method is case sensitive. It only check start words of characters .means if we string starts with small letter and we are checking with capital letter then it return false value.
Suppose if want to check my word is present at start of string or not then we use startWith method]
Like 
String s3=”my name is rahul”; 
System.out.println(s3.startsWith(“my”)); // here we get output true b’coz my is present at 
				Starting of string.


8. endsWith());
When we to check only end character’s of string then we endsWith() method if character’s are present at end of string then it will return true otherwise false . This method is also case sensitive. 
Suppose if want check the end characters of string then we use endsWith method like suppose if we have string value
String s3=”my name is rahul”; 
System.out.println(s3.endsWith(“rahul”)); // here we are checking end characters then we 
				Will get O/p true b’coz rahul is present at end of 
					Srting.
9.	charAt(index)
When want to print one character  in original string value of specific index then we use charAt(index) method.
Suppose if want print l which is  at index 2 of string velocity then we use charAt(index) method.
String s1=”velocity”;]
Syso(s1.charAt(2)); // here we will get O/p l as we use charAt(index) method
Suppose if we specify the index and that index is consist of space the it if return space also.  
10.	IndexOf()
When we pass character and we want to find the index of that character then we can use indexOf () method this method start searching from starting. Here we are finding index of char then compiler start searching form 0th index if whenever char is found then it will return that index and skip remaining index if that char is present in string in different index then also it will print only first appearance index of that char. This method is case sensitive 

Suppose if we pass char and we want find value of that char then we use indexOf() method 
String s4=” abcabca” ;
Syso(s4.indexOf(‘a’)); // here compiler will return index value of a which is 0.
Here we are finding index of char then compiler start searching form 0th index if whenever char is found then it will return that index and skip remaining index if that char is present in string in different index then also it will print only first index of that char.
11.	lastindexOf ():
If we want check  character of index  from last or in reverse order then we use lastindexOf () then it will return index of character which is last occurs.
Suppose if we want to find index of b from last then we use indexOf method
Sting s4=”abcabcabc”;
Syso(s4.lastindexOf(‘b’)) // it return the  7 which last index of b.
12.	replace method;
when we want to replace any word from the string then we use replace method.
This methods are case sensitive means suppose we want replace word which is in lower case but we mention that word in upper case then it will show error. We can replace any word and replace word length can be any larger of small also.

Suppose if we want replace rahul with ganesh then we have to use replace method.

String s3=”my name is rahul”; 
Syso(s3.replace(”rahul”,”ganesh”)); // here rahul is get replace with ganesh.

13.	Substring(begin index)
When want to print from one specific character to all character in a string then we use then we use substring method.
Suppose if we have string and we want print from c to all onward character then we use substring(). Like
String s1=”velocity”;
Syso(s1.substring(4))// here we use substring method then we will get all charter printed form 
		4th index to last charter. i.e. city
Here we are using substring method so we have give the begin index here from that index it will print all character from end.
indexOf() method:
•	The indexOf() method is used to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified character or substring within a string.
•	It returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified character or substring, or -1 if the character or substring is not found.
•	The method has two variants:
•	indexOf(int ch): Finds the index of the specified character.
•	indexOf(String str): Finds the index of the specified substring.


14.	Substring(begin index, end index)
When we want to print some middle charter then we use substring method but we have to give begin index value and end index value+1 from which we want to print characters 
Suppose we want to print only some middle characters then we use substring (begin index, end index) like 
String s1 =”velocity”;
Syso(s1.substring(1,6) // here we are printing values from index 1 to 5 that’ why we give end
		Index 6 b’coz compiler only prints value before end index. i.e. we get 
		O/p eloci 
As here we are using substring method with begin index and end index then compiler will print characters from begin index and stop at before which we give end index that’s why we have to give end index+1 value which we want to print.
lastIndexOf() method:
•	The lastIndexOf() method is used to find the index of the last occurrence of a specified character or substring within a string.
•	It returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified character or substring, or -1 if the character or substring is not found.
•	The method also has two variants:
•	lastIndexOf(int ch): Finds the index of the last occurrence of the specified character.
•	lastIndexOf(String str): Finds the index of the last occurrence of the specified substring.

15.	concat()
when want to combine two string then we use concatenate symbol + i.e. plus sign or concat method by using any one we can combine two and more than two strings.
Suppose we want to combine two string then we use concat method or + symbol or operator 
Like 
String s1=”velocity”;
String s2=”VELOCITY”;  
String s3=”hello”;
Syso(s1+s2) // here we get output velocityVELOCITY
Syso(s1.concat(s2)); // here we get output velocityVELOCITY
Syso(s1.concat(s2).concat(s3)); // here we are combining three string we will get out
			 velocitVELOCITYhello
16.   isEmpty 
when we want to verify that the string is empty or not then we use then we use isEmpty method. If string is empty then it show true and if string have character or string contain only blank space then also it show false. Because in string blank space is also consider as string.
Suppose if we want verify that string is empty or not then we use isEmpty method
String s1=”velocity”;
String s2=””;
Syso(s1.isEmpty()) // it show output false
Syso(s2.isEmpty()) // it show output true b’coz string is empty it doesn’t have any char or blank space 
17. Spilt()
When want spit or divide string into different variable/ word  then we use spilt () method. Spit divide one string words into different variable at each this words are same type i.e. string type then this words are stored in string arrays at different index. Split divide one string value into multiple string values. So here it converting in different variable then we cant store this values in single variable then we use array.
Suppose we want split one string value into different word then we use split method. It divide one statement or paragraph into separate sperate word  and store this words in string arrays.
Suppose we have string value and we want convert this string into word then in this case we use split method.
Like 
String s1= “my name is rahul”;
String [] ar =s1.split(“ ”); // here first we have create array first then perform spilt operation string here we are using split method it will split from blank space present between word. It 
                       will separate word from blank space. And we will get o/p like my (0) name(1) is(2) rahul(3).	
For(int i=0;i<=ar.length-1;i++) // as we are print all values in array 
{
Syso(ar.[i]); 
}

Here we are suing split method so first we have to create string array to store string values and then we perform split operation and all string value are store in arrays at different index on string all word are get separated by space available between two word all word are separated which are right and left side of space. If there is no space available then we cant perform split operation usually. We can also split word if one char is connecting to word from that word compiler skip or ignore that word and only print word which are left and right of that word or space also.

The split() method in Java is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter. Here's a simple and short explanation:
•	The split() method takes a delimiter as an argument and splits the original string into multiple substrings.
•	It returns an array of strings containing the substrings.
•	The delimiter is used to determine where the original string should be split. It can be a single character, a sequence of characters, or a regular expression.
•	The resulting substrings do not include the delimiter itself.
•	If the delimiter is not found in the original string, the split() method returns an array with a single element containing the original string.

Exception handling: 
What is exception?
During the execution of java program JVM faces abnormal situation based on code declaration.
If JVM faces abnormal situation then JVM trigger’s an event this events is known as expectation.
 Abnormal situation are like suppose we declare  an integer array which capacity is 4 means it can store 4 integers values but if we want store 5th integer value at 4 index then we will exception like arrayindexoutOfBondsexcepction 
Like if decleare string which length of 0t3 but when we want to print char value at 4th place by using the charAtmethod  then its show exception StringIndexOutOfBondexception 
Or 
Suppose we have two integer a=10 and b=0 and we want to perform division operation on that then this is not possible then we see exception like ArithmaticException 
Whenever JVM gets exception then program execution is stop or get terminated at that line and code after that line is not run by JVM.
We have to write program in that way whenever exception is face by JVM then also all our codes are run by the JVM. For that we use exception handling.

Handling the event generated by JVM during the program execution is known as exception handling 
Its recommended to handle events during execution flow only 
1)When exception handle  then we will get result in normal flow of the program and 
All remaining statements are going to get executed.
2)  if we don’t handle the exception then program gets terminated and before getting terminated its prints the reasons for termination.
To Handel exception we have two block Which is try and catch block
If our program have code by which exception may cause means its risky code then we have to declare that code in try block body and to handle exception cause by risky cod we use catch block after try block. in catch block we handle exception by mentioning name of exception cause by risky code in between parenthesis of catch() with object name to store exception cause by code in exception name. and we can give printing message in catch body to show which type of exception is this. If exception is caused in try block then only JVM enters in catch block and handle that exception if catch body exception is matched with exception occurred by code. And all codes after that are also executed. 
Every exception is present in Class Name in java that are inbuild class. that are stored in Java Project lang package.
try is keyword then open and close curly braces 
syntax of try and catch 
try
{
}
Catch(expectionName objectName)
{
	//we can give printing statement 
}
For example
try
{
    ar[4]=10;
}
Catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBound Obj)
{
Syso(“ArrayIndexOutOfBound handled”);
}
In one try block we can add only one risky code init.
We Can use multiple catch block for on try block when we know that exception may cause but we don’t know exactly  which exception it may cause then we can add multiple catch block but there is condition that name of exception or catch block name should be different at every time. We Can add multiple catch block but at time only one catch block is executed by JVM.
If we give catch block and mention different exception but exception occurred by code is not matching with exception which we mention in catch block then then program execution is stopped at line where exception is cause at which line.
Super exception or generic exception:
Suppose if we don’t know that exception is occurring or not and which type of exception is occurring but we want that if exception occurred then also program execution must continue then we don’t want to fail program if exception is occurred.
For that there is one super exception available in java for every exception  like object class which is super most class in java. By using super exception we can handle any exception is called generic exception.
Syntax of Super exception :
Try
{
}
Catch(exception e) // super exception object name
{
}
When we use generic exception then we don’t understand which exception is occurred. To know that we which exception is occurred in try block we use
ObjectName.PrintStackTrace(); // printStackTarce method
e.printStackTrace();
objectName.printStacktarce is print the address of exception which occurred in try block.it gives the information which exception is occurred in try block.
Direct use of generic is no recommend we have to mention some exception first and at last we can use generic exception.
Multiple try and Catch block:
When we have multiple risky code then we have to use multiple try and catch block in one try block we can declare only one risky code in it.
Like 
try 
{
}
catch (exception objectName)
{
}
try 
{
}
catch (exception objectName)
{
}
Nested try block
We can also use try block within try block is called as nested try block.
Here we give risky code in first try block body and to handle the exception we give catch block after that then we declare second risky code and exception occurred by 2nd code is handle by outer catch block.

		try
		{
			try
			{
				//risky code 1
			}
			catch ()
			{
				// TODO: handle exception
			}
			
			//risky code 2
			
		}
		catch()
		{
			
		}
					
		}
Can we use multiple try block?
No. we cant use multiple try blocks.
We can use multiple try and catch blocks.








 
 
 
 
 


Star pattern:
When column values are different in every row.
Rules are same here also use outer for loop for row and inner for loop for column. And the we use printing statement by using print to print value of star. And empty println statement for next line.
*
**
***
Suppose if we want to print above pattern 
Then we simple all the columns present in first row we will store it into variable like here column size 1 then we will store it into variable like
int star=1;
then we give outer for loop for row and inner for loop for columns.
and inner loop we use variable which we declare and we give increment operation like
		for(int i=1;i<=3;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=a;j++)
			{
				
			}
In inner loop we use print statement for to print star here cursor is not move to next line. 

			
				System.out.print("*");
		
And after inner for loop completed then we use empty print statement for to cursor goes to new line.
Here we add one more steps that here we value of star is increasing by 1 when it goes to next row for that we use variableName and increment or decrement operation 

int a=1;
		for(int i=1;i<=3;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=a;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			a++; // like this
		}
			
When we run this program then i value is one which is less than equal to 3 condition is true then compiler will entered in inner for loop for to print column available in first row. Here compiler will enter in inner for loop and check j value which is 1 and then check second condition i.e. j<=a i.e. 1<=1 condition is true now complier will enter into for loop and print * and cursor is present at this line b’coz we use print and now compiler will execute third parameter which is j++ now it will increase j value by i.e. 2 and check condition i.e. j<=a now j value is 2 i.e. 2<=1 condition false then compiler will stop execution of inner for loop compiler will exit from loop and execute in empty println statement and then it will increment value of a i.e. 1 to 2 and again goes into outer for loop and increment value of i by 1 i.e. 2 and check second parameter i.e. i<=3 now value of i is 2 i.e. 2<=3 condition is true then compiler will enter in inner for loop and check value of j is 1 and it will check 2nd condition i.e. j<=a now value of a is 2 then now 2<=2 condition is true then compiler will enter in inner for loop body and execute print statement and it will print * and cursor is not move to next line then compiler will check the third parameter i.e. j++ now j value is get increment by 1 i.e. 1 to 2 and then it will check 2nd parameter i.e. j<=a i.e. j<=2 condition is true then it will print * then it will check 3rd parameter and j value is incremented by 1 i.e. 3 now condition is get false and it will stop execution of inner loop and exit from inner loop and execute println move cursor to next line and then execute a value by 1 i.e. 3 and again goes into outer loop and this will continue until outer loop condition get false and we will get our output  like 

*
**
***
If we want increment by two  then we use varibleName =variableName+2;
Like a=a+2; for increment by two then we use a+3
If we want to print in revers of descending order then then row and column condition is same only increment or decrement operation is on perform on  variable name like s-- or VaribaleName-- after empty println statement 

Like we want to print 



*****
****
***
**
*


int s=5;
		for(int i=1;i<=5;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=s; j++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			s--;	
Automation Testing:
Testing an application features with the help of automation tool and executing test scripts is called automation testing.
Test scripts converting manual test cases into program by using programming language and automation tool  and after that program is executing then is called test scripts.
Disadvantages of manual testing:
1.	compatibility testing is difficult. 
 Means we run same test case on different different browser is called compatibility testing. We done compatibility because there are chances that some test case can may run properly on chrome but that can not run properly on another properly to ensure or verify  that we perform compatibility testing.
It requires executing the test cases on multiple browsers to ensure compatibility. This adds complexity and effort to the testing process.
2.	Test cycle duration will be increased. 
(is time required to perform testing in one sprint)

Means suppose we have 100 test case and to perform that test case on one browser then we need 1 week and if we want test it on 5 different browser then it will need 5 week due this test cycle duration will increase.( To start execution of next sprint our current test cycle duration will get increase and we have to spend more time on current sprint.)
3.	More efforts are required.
 Means suppose if want to test testcase on different browser and suppose for to test on one browser we need 1 week and we want to test it on 5 browser then we will need five week but if we want complete this it into this sprint then we need to deploy more efforts or people on this  due to this project cost will get increase.
4.	Regression testing is time consuming.  
Means suppose we are in sprint number 5 and we develop new features in it and we integrate this features with main module or previously develop module then we have to test this new feature by performing smoke functional testing and along with we have to check this new develop module with previous modules also because sometime due integration of new module previous module is not work properly so to check that we perform regression testing every time in each sprint  when new module is added.
We perform automation testing to perform regression testing and compatibility testing.

Advantages of automation testing: 
1.	Reusability of test scripts. 
Means we can reuse that scripts suppose if we convert manual test case into scripts then we can use it multiple times. Suppose if we convert manual test cases into scripts then after that in each sprint we will not check this test cases manually we can simply run this script and we will get final results.
2.	Compatibility testing is easy or possible. 
Means suppose if we convert test cases into scripts to run on chrome then we can use this same scripts on different browser easily by changing or modifying two lines of code by which we can run same scripts on different browser.
3.	When we perform  automation testing then less human efforts are required. 
4.	Project duration will be reduce. 
Means in case of manual testing project duration is increasing because we have to perform compatibility and regression testing manually.
5.	To overcome drawback of regression testing.
 We can perform regression testing easily by converting old test cases into scripts and we can check all old features in each sprint and new features are tested manually. 
6.	Cost of project will be reduce. 
Because we don’t need extra efforts to perform testing.
Which Test Cases to Automate? 
Test cases to be automated can be selected using the following criterion to increase the automation ROI 
• High Risk – Business Critical test cases 
• Test cases that are repeatedly executed 
• Test Cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually 
• Test Cases which are time-consuming The following category of test cases are not suitable for automation:
 • Test Cases that are newly designed and not executed manually at least once 
• Test Cases for which the requirements are frequently changing
 • Test cases which are executed on an ad-hoc basis.
Some of the automation tools are available in market :
1.	Selenium 
2.	QTP
3.	Sahi/Sahi pro
4.	Selendroid 
5.	Appium 
6.	Selenium
7.	TestingWhiz
8.	 HPE Unified Functional Testing (HP – UFT formerly QTP)
9.	TestComplete
10.	Ranorex
11.	Sahi
12.	Watir
13.	Tosca Testsuite
14.	Telerik TestStudio
15.	Katalon Studio
16.	Cucumber 
Advantage of Selenium:
Selenium is tool for to perform automation testing.
1.Open source. 
Means we can use this tool for free of cost.
2. Multi language supportable.
 Means we can use multiple programming language java , python, ruby ,Perl ?
	Python
	Java
	C-Sharp
	JavaScript
	Ruby
	PHP
	Perl

3.	Cross browser /compatibility testing is possible.
 Means we can use same scripts of different different browser.
4.	Cross platform is also supportable. 
Means creating code in one OS we Can run this code in Different OS also. Suppose if we create code by using java and selenium in one operating system then we can use that same code in different operating systems also.
Disadvantages of Selenium:
1.	We can automate only web base application.
 Means application which are available on web means to open that application we need browser and internet and by entering URL we can open that application.
2.	We Cannot automate standalone application and desktop application .
 Stand alone application which are already install in system and we don’t need to enter URL to open that application. Like calculator paint etc.
3.	We can’t automate captcha and Barcode.
 If we want to automate that then we have use third party app and integrate with selenium to automate captcha and bar code.
4.	Selenium will not support file uploading.
 Means suppose we have to upload profile picture then we see browse window to choose picture for our device that file upload window are not automated by using selenium.
5.	Ad-hoc testing test  cases can’t be automated.
 Means we have knowledge but we have less test data and teste case this test cases are also not automated by using selenium. Here we need proper input and proper steps then only we can convert into automation.
6.	We can’t read barcode by using selenium.

Java concepts used in automation:
1.	Inheritance 
2.	Interface 
3.	Polymorphism
4.	Casting (up casting)
5.	Encapsulation
6.	Abstraction 
7.	Arrays
8.	Collection
9.	For loop, for each, while loop & intercoder 
10.	Control statements
11.	String Class
Selenium Flavours or versions:
1. Selenium IDE (integrated development environment)
1. We can run scripts in only Firefox browser.  limitation . means cant run scripts in different browsers.
2. record and Playback. We can recode and see when we run scripts. Advantage 
3. we can’t do compatibility testing  limitation .
4. only support java programming language.  limitation .
2. selenium RC(Remote Control)
1. support Compatibility testing means we can run scripts on different browsers.  advantage 
2. we can run scripts in only java language.  limitation.

3. selenium web Driver (Selenium Tool)
1. supports compatibility testing. advantages 
2. we can run scripts in multiple languages. advantages

4.  Selenium Grid 
1. when we have many (1000) test cases and we run this scripts in one pc then scripts execute one by one and it take too much time to overcome this there is selenium grid by using this we can run few cases on different different pc it will divide test cases on 4-5 pc and it will executed in less time. And we will get result in quick time.
We don’t use selenium grid we use test NG Framework to perform same functionality.
5.	Selendroid:
To automate android application.
6.	Appium :
To automate IOS application.
Selenium installation:
Selenium is readymade framework in which many packages and classes are present in it we have install it and configure with our project so that by using methods available in selenium we will automate our test cases.
We will install latest stable version available which is 4.5.3 
Step3: Configure selenium jar file into our selenium project.
	1. right click on project
	2. select build path
	3. select configure build path
	4. click on Libraries tab.
	5. click on Add external jars.
	5. browse selenium jar file.
	6. Apply
	7. Apply & close
To open browser we have to download .exe file of that browser 
Browser is called as driver 
Suppose if its chrome then we have to check version of chrome and we have to download .exe or ChromeDriver.exe file for our chrome browser version 
We are using 107.0.53 chrome version
First Program By using selenium:
There are two steps we have to follow
Step 1: 
we have to set path of ChromeDriver.exe files path.
We have to give the path for open browser of to run the scripts we have to give path
For to set this path we have one class which System in which there is static method  which is setProperty  as it static method of System Class to use this static method of different class we have to give the
 System.setProperty(“”,””);  //  diffrentclassName.MethodName();
 Here we have to give two string inputs.
1.	First parameter : 
Name of the(selenium version) browser.  And while give the name of browser we have to give name in small characters.
Here we  have to give
webdriver.chrome.driver // version of selenium.nameofbrowser.driver
2.	Second parameter :  
Path of browser 
"C:\\Users\\sanja\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Study\\3rdSept Mrng\\chromedriver_win32 (1)\\chromedriver.exe"
When we run 
System.setProperty(“webdriver.chrome.driver”,” "C:\\Users\\sanja\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\Study\\3rd Sept Mrng\\chromedriver_win32 (1)\\chromedriver.exe");
Step 2: 
Create object of ChromeDriver Class
 When add selenium jar file then there are many packages are available there and in that packages many classes are also available. When expand selenium jar file then we can see many packages.
We have to use that packages to open browser by creating object ChromeDriver Class which is present in org.openqa.selenium.chrome package  when we expand it then there is class present ChromeDriver Class.
We have create of ChromeDriver Class
Like 
ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); 
When we create object and run program the browser will open automatically.



Driver manger
WebDriverManager is a Java library that automates the management of web drivers. It can automatically download the required driver binaries, such as ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver, or EdgeDriver, and configure them for use with Selenium.
In Selenium, a driver manager is a tool or utility that helps manage the different drivers required for browser automation. Here's a simple and short explanation:
•	A driver manager in Selenium is responsible for managing and providing the necessary drivers for different web browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.
•	It ensures that the appropriate driver executable files are available and compatible with the Selenium framework.
•	The driver manager handles tasks like downloading, installing, and configuring the drivers required by Selenium to automate the selected browser.
•	By using a driver manager, you don't need to manually download and set up the drivers. It simplifies the process and ensures compatibility between the driver version and the Selenium version being used.
•	Commonly used driver managers in Selenium include ChromeDriver (for Chrome), GeckoDriver (for Firefox), and WebDriverManager (a third-party library that handles driver management for multiple browsers).
Using a driver manager helps streamline the setup and configuration of browser automation in Selenium, making it easier to work with different browsers without manually managing the associated drivers.

    WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

Selenium installation


Step1: Create a new java project  (Create module & don't create module--->Select don't create module)

Step2: Download selenium jar file.

Step3: Configure selenium jar file into our selenium project.
	1. right click on project
	2. select build path
	3. select configure build path
	4. click on Libraries tab.
	5. click on Add external jars.
	5. browse selenium jar file.
	6. Apply
	7. Apply & close

note:
--if add external jar file is disabled--
 Class path & module path ---> select class path option

Step4: download "ChromeDriver.exe" file
		Pre-condition: check current chrome browser version
	1. unzip downloaded ChromeDriver.exe file

-----------------

1st selenium program:  open browser

Step1: Set ChromeDriver.exe file path by using System.setProperty(parameter1, Parameter2) method
	parameter1- name of browser (small letter)
	parameter2- path of browser 

Step2: Create an object of ChromeDriver class

Selenium architecture
 
(When we want to perform upcasting then we have to cerate object of supper class or supper interface with reference to sub class so that properties which are inherited to supper class to sub class only that methods of superclass are eligible for the upcasting.
Like 
In sample1 class when we want to access properties of only demo1 then we cerate object of sample1 class with reference to demo1 interface means only properties of demo is available for upcasting.
Demo1 n=new sample1(); // here we cerate object of sample1 and only properties of demo1 is store 
	in object n here demo1 interface is act as datatype here. All the methods  of interface is completed in demo implementation class and all this properties plus own properties of implementation class is extends in other subclass means by creating object of sub class with reference to interface then only properties of interface is inherited to super class or in super interface)
selenium architecture:
 
1.SearchContext
 is uppermost interface which contains abstract methods and this methods is inherited to WebDriver.
2. WebDriver 
Is  an interface which contain abstract methods of SearchContext and it’s own methods  abstracts methods also.
All incomplete methods are overridden or implemented in Selenium RemoteWebDriver Class

3.	 RemoteWebDriver class

 is implementation class which implements’ all the abstract methods of both interface.
4.	Selenium RemoteWebDriver Class is extends to browsers such as chrome, Firefox, etc.
To Run Application in multiple Browsers Is called as compatibility testing. i.e. writing the test scripts by using single browser but run the same script in multiple browser we need to use run time polymorphism by using upcasting in selenium.
WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); // this statement is belong to upcasting as well as 
				Runtime 
Here we are performing upcasting means accessing properties of super interface by creating object of sub class.
And runtime polymorphism means it depending on which class object we carting then we can only use the properties of class particular class. suppose if we cerate object of ChromeDriver then binding of chrome browser methods only.



In selenium architecture here are first SearchContext  super interface is available with some incompletes methods this all incomplete methods are  extends in 2nd interface Which is WebDriver now all incomplete methods  of both interface is available in 2nd interface i.e. WebDriver and we provide definition to all incomplete methods from SearchContext and WebDriver are completed in implementation Class which is  RemoteWebDriver. 
In selenium we have separate classes available for each and every browser like suppose if want use Chrome Browser then there is separate class Available for Chrome which is ChromeDriver for others browser also. And in this browser Class all properties of Implementation class are extends in each class of specific browser.
Suppose we want  to open browser like suppose if want to open Chrome Browser then We have cerate object of Chrome browser Class i.e. ChromeDriver with reference to super interface i.e. WebDriver 
Like 
	WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver(); // this upcasting in selenium 
Here we care creating object of sub class i.e. ChromeDriver with reference of  interface i.e. WebDriver here WebDriver is Act As datatype means only properties of WebDriver we can access in object i.e. driver. 
Advantage of selenium architecture
1.	By performing up casting (also architecture also)in selenium we can perform compatibility testing easily.
WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
Here we are using selenium version of WebDriver
When want to run same Scripts on different browsers then we have to cerate object of WebDriver with reference/datatype to browser which we want to use like chrome of Firefox etc.
Here we are accessing properties of WebDriver which is present in ChromeDriver Subclass.
In upcasting we can only access properties of super class only either we cerate object of sub class.

2.	Here we are using selenium version of WebDriver when call methods by objectName.methodName then we can access all methods which are present in WebDriver with specific browsers. 
3.	Runtime Polymorphism: Runtime polymorphism allows us to invoke specific method implementations based on the actual object type at runtime. In Selenium, the WebDriver interface defines methods like get() and close(), which are implemented differently by the specific browser drivers. By upcasting to WebDriver, we can leverage runtime polymorphism to execute the appropriate driver-specific method. For example:
javaCopy code
driver.get("https://www.example.com"); // Invokes the 'get()' method of the specific browser driver 
The actual implementation of the get() method will be based on the specific browser driver, such as ChromeDriver or FirefoxDriver, used during upcasting.
By combining upcasting and runtime polymorphism, we can write concise and flexible code that opens a browser and performs actions using the common WebDriver methods.


WebDriver:
It is an interface use to perform action of browser.
We don’t perform action browser element like button like user name login button sign up etc.

Methods in selenium(webdriver methods) 

1.	get- to enter URL in browser or to open an application.
To enter URL in browser we use get method which is available in WebDriver
Here we have to enter URL in String format like
objectName.get(“NameOFURL”); like That

2.close: to close the current tab of the browser.
When want close current tab in browser then we use close() method.
Syntax is 
Object.close();
When loading of page is stope then it close the current tab.


3.quit: to close the all the tabs present in browser.
When want close all tab in browser and terminate it then we use quit() method
Syntax is 
Object.quit();
When loading of page is stope then it close the all tabs and terminate or close browser.


Whenever we open link in selenium then every time then it open only single tab.
4. getTitle (): To get the title of application we use getTitle() method.
Whenever we open any webapplication then each application have its unique title so using getTitle method we can get title of application   in Console. 
To get title of application for that one method is available in webdriver interface which is gettile() method.
GetTtle():String:Webdriver
Gettile method is available in webdriver interface and its return the output in String type.
Return type of getTile method is String.
And when one of method is returning output then we can call this method in two type 
1.	by storing  output return by method in variable by declaring variable 
2.	or simply in printing statement.
1.  approach of calling methods With return Type Suppose if we want to print title then we use getTitle method
Like
String title=driver.getTitle();
System.out.println(title);  // we will get output title of application
2. approach of calling methods With return Type
System.out.println(driver.getTile());  // we will get output title of application
Suppose  if we open filpkart side then we see title like online site for shopping mobile, etc

5.	getCurrentUrl() method: this method is use to get or return  Url of application.
This getCurrentUrl () is also string return Type and this method is also available in WedDriver inertface.
getCurrentUrl():String:WebDriver

URL is always present in String Format. getCurrentUrl() will return String Output 
We can call this method is two way 
1.	approach is
String url=driver.getCurrentUrl();
System.out.println(url); // we will get Url of application
2.	 approach is
System.out.println(driver.getCurrnetUrl()); // we will get URL of application
6.	Maximize(): this method is use to maximize the browser.
driver.manage().window().maximize() // 
				objectName.manage().window().maximize()

To maximize the browser here we don’t have any direct method available.
To use  maximize method first we have to manage() method which is manage() will return the output of options interface and manage() method is availbe in WebDriver
manage():Options:WebDriver 
Options s1=driver.mange(); // s1 is object of Options
window s2=s1.window(); // s1 is object of options s2 is object of window 
s2.maximize(); // this method is use to maximize the browser
Window():window-Options
Window() methods is available in Options interface and its returns output of window interface.
maximize (): void-window
 
7.	minimize(): this method is used to minimize the browse.
Syntax 
ObjectName.maanage().window().minimize();
 When we run this method then After Loading URL immediately it minimize the browser.
Minimize and maximize is methods of window interface. Its not method of WebDriver.
Suppose if we want to stop or wait for sometime after execution of one task to complete next task then there is one method availbe in java which is 
 Suppose if we want to wait for minimize for few second after URL load then we Can use 
We have to call threadClass.sleep(); 
Thread.sleep(long millisecond); method
Thread is inbuild Class available in Java and sleep is static method available in thread  class.
We have to give time parameters or input in sleep method in millisecond. This method use the input in millisecond 
Suppose if want wait for 4Second then we give input in millisecond like. 4000
We have to call threadClass.sleep(4000);  // here compiler wait for 4sec
When we use this satement then its gives use error i.e. unhandledexceptiontypeexception  to handle this compiler force use to use throws keywords or try of catch block then we use throws keywords by hovering mouse cursor on sleepmethod then compiler will automatically add throws in front of main method and handle the Interrupted Exception 
8.	Navigate().to(url): we can enter URL int browser by using navigate method also is alternate method for get method.
Is any alternate method to enter URL in browser?
Yes. By using navigate  method.


navigate():navigation-WebDriver

navigate() method is available in WebDriver interface and it returns output of navigation interface.
To enter URL by using navigate method we use .to() method

to:void-naviagtion  return type of to is void and its method of navigation interface
to enter URL we use like
objectName.naviagte().to(“URL”);
difference between get and navigate:
 when we use get() then we can only open URL in browser. But when we open URL in browser by using navigate() method then we can perform navigation operation in browser like back, forward and reload addition functionalities are available in navigate ()  method.
Suppose if we open to link in same tab by using navigate () two time and we give delay of 2 second in between two links then compiler will open first link then wait for 2 sec and then it will open second link 
9.	Back(): we use back method then it perform backwards or back navigation.
Syntax is 
objectName.naviagte().back()
10.	forward(): we to perform forward navigation.
Syntax 
objectName.navigate().forward();
11.	refresh () : is use perform to refresh navigation on the current page of browser.
Sysnatx;
objectName.naviaget().refresh();



Method name	Return type 	interface
getTile()	String	WebDriver
getCurrentUrl()	String	WebDriver
manage()	Options interface output 	WebDriver
Window()	window interface output 	Options
maximize ()	void	window
minimize ()	void	window
navigate ()	Navigation interface output	WebDriver
To()	void	navigation
Back()	void	Navigation
forward()	void	Navigation 
refresh ()	void	Navigation 
findElement(By by)	WebElemnt	webdriver
Sendkeys()	void	WebElemnt
Click()	void	WebElemnt
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		


Methods with return type:
When we declare method by using void  then when we call this types methods then it simply return value or output in console but if want use that output generated by method in main method as input  to perform any operation then it’s not possible when we use void return type in method.
void is return type return type is use to show that method is returning any value or not.
when method type is void the this method is not return any inputs in program it simply show the output in console. 
When we use void then compiler will execute all then code which is present in that method and perform operation on that and simply return output in console when we call that method in main method.
Like 
public static void addition(int a, int b)
{
     Int sum=a+b;
Syso(“sum”);
}
As it’s  static method so we call this method in main method in static way i.e.
Addition(int a, int b);			 // MethodName b’coz we accessing in same class
When we want use values/output return by regular methods then we use datatype as return type means which datatypes value is return by this regular method by using return keyword and variableName   at the end of method body means last statement is return variableName.
Like 
public static int addition (int a, int b); // method with integer return type 
{
   int sum1=a+b;
return sum1; 
}
Here we give last statement is return statement with varibleName which  storing  value of perform by operation.
When we are using return type method then we have to specify the datatype which type of value/output is return by regular method.
Suppose if regular method is returning int value then we have to give int datatype while declaring method.
When we call return type method in main method then we will see three parameters  1.methodName(parameters): return type: ClassName (in which class method is present ) 
When we Call  return type method in main method then there are two approaches
1.	by storing  output return by method in variable by declaring variable 
2.	or simply in printing statement.

1.	Datatype variableName =MethodName();
int sum=addition(int a, int b)
System.out.println(sum);
When we want reuse output return by regular method then we use this method in which first compiler will run addition method and perform operation and store value in sum. Then printing statement will print the value of sum. And we want perform multiplication on output return by method then simply perform operation by using (sum*sum) and we will get result i.e. 900
2.	System.out.println(addition(int a, int b ));
3.	When we use this second approach when we only want to print output of method and we are not performing any operation or using for input then we simply print output by using printing statement. System.out.println(addition(int a, int b ));

One return type method will only return one datatype output at time.
More than one value is not return by method at time.
we can  also call non-static regular method by using return type. 
Like 
public int mul (int a, int b)
{
     int mul1=a*b;
      return mul1;
}
Here as we are using non static regular method so first we have to cerate object of class then by ObjectName.MethodName(parameters);
To call non-static regular method there are two approaches.
ClassName ObjectName=new ClassName();
ObjectName.MethodName();
Sample s=new Sample();
s.mul(int a, int b);
1.	Datatype variableName =objectName.MethodName();
int mul2=s.mul1(int a, int b);
this approach is use when want to reuse the output generated by regular method in main method as input then we use this approach here we are storing output generated by regular method in Mul2 variable and by using that method output we can perform other operation  on that in main method also. 
2.	Second Approach is 
System.out.println(objectName.methodName());
System.out.println(s.mul1());
We use this approach when we only want to print output of regular method and don want reuse in main method then we can give simply printing statement an in that we give objectName.methodName and we get output in console.

This return types method are also call form different class also.
By using int return type method we get int output by pass String inputs 
Like 
public int findlegthofString(String s)
{
   int a=s.length();
    return a;
}
Here we are giving string input by suing variable s and in body we are counting length of that string input and storing in length value which is int type I a variable which is int type and we are returning value of a.
When we call this method in main method then as its is non static method so first we have to crate the object of class and then using objectName.methodName we are calling this method suppose if we give the string input so then this goes to findlengthOfstring method and return the length of string and store this int value in a and returning value of a. here 
We store output generated by return method in int data type like
Data type=objectName.MethodName(“”);
int b = s1.FindlengthofString(“hi”);
System.out.println(b);
2.  approach 
System.out.println(s1.findlethofString(“hi”));
Basic HTML:
If we want to perform action on browser elements (user name ,password, login button, etc.) For that we use web elements.
Suppose we want to perform action of web elements the we have to find address of elements.
Suppose if we want to perform action on element like user name password then we have to find address of that elements.
All web pages are developed with HTML language.

HTML :
Hypertext markup language is used for creating webpage.
HTML coding is not case sensitive. Means key word which are use in HTML are not case sensitive.  But in java programming language all key words are case sensitive and all key word are available  in lower cases and if we use keywords in uppercase then it wont acts as a keyword. But in HTML keyword are not case sensitive.
We can write HTML coding in notepad/ notepad++.
While saving HTML file, we have to use .html extension  “filename.html”. when we cerate HTML file then we should use .html extension  for saving html file.

Q1. Write  a HTML code to create dummy web page.

webpage
 

Web have title only and body is empty means no elements are created here 


	First we have open keyword HTML like  <html>then we have to close this HTML keyword like </html> when we open and close html then it will cerate webpage for us in this web page we can add title, body ,table, etc. as here we cerate one webpage by oping and closing html then we can add title in this to cerate title then title keyword is open and then close <title> open then </title >  close. In between  we can give title which we want then we can give like dummy webpage. Then it will cerate web page with title whenever we open this html file by clicking on it which is store in our system.
Code is :
		<html>
		<title>
		Dummy webpage
		</title>
		</html>
Q2. Write a html code to cerate following webpage  which contain title and body.
webpage
Hello
Good Morning 
<html>
<title>
Webpage
</title>
			<body>
			Good Morning
			</body>
			</html>
Here we cerate we page by opening and closing HMLT keyword and in between we add title by opening and closing the title and then we add body by opening and closing body and information in it like Good Morning.
Q3. Write a html code to create following page which contain  User Name, password , etc
. for sign up 
This  include User Name , Password , email Id, Contact, gender , male and female radio button, check box for I agree one link for reflecting on other page and sign up page button.
Here first we will cerate web page by opening and closing the html key word then here we want add elements here then we create that elements inside body by creating body like opening and closing body keyword. 
Then in between  that first element is User name text box for that we write code
	User Name
Here we have create interface which accepts then user input for that we open keyword i.e. input  for to cerate web page component(user name, password , radio button,check box etc) we use input keyword along with we have to specify the type which type of element is this like text ,password ,or radio button like that like <input type=’text’> this cerate user name  label which is text type. 
Then we create second label for password like password  <input type=’password’> here we use type = password because password should be encrypted from for that we use password type like then we can see *** so it cant be understood by other person. Here to break line then we use br keyword at end like <br> then it will break that line and cursor will move to next line.
Third element is email id for that we use email ID <input type=’text’> <br> here we use br keyword means this line terminate here and cursor is move to next line. Email id is text type then type is text.
For gender we use 
gender <br>
male <input type=’radio’> <br>
female<input type=’radio’><br>
here gender is text then we use br means that  line is terminated there
then male is text and here we are adding radio button which is element for that we use <input type =’radio’> here its radio button that why we use type = radio.
For female it also radio button.

To cerate check box as it is elements then we use <input type=’checkbox’> I agree <br> here I agree is text 
Here we cerate one link by clicking on that we will reflect to other page suppose if we create forgot password then we will reflect on other page.
To cerate link we use keyword a  here we have to mention the name of text like forgot password  or other text which we are to use then we also have to add URL for that by which we or user can get reflected to other page we to add that next page URL also. For to give URL of next page there is one attribute i.e. href i.e.  hyper reference 
<a href= ‘link of next page’> here we mention the text of link </a> closing with a.
sign Up button its element then we have to use input type = ‘button’  and on that button there is some text available then to mention that text we use  value =’text which we want on that button’.
Like
<input type=’button’ value=sing up’>

<html>
<body>
		UN <input type='text'> <br>
		PWD <input type='password'> <br>
		Email<input type='text'> <br>
		Mob Num<input type='text'> <br>
		Gender<br>
			Male <input type='radio'><br>
			Female<input type='radio'> <br>
		<input type='checkbox'> I Agree <br>
		<a href='https://www.facebook.com/'>facebook</a> <br>
		<input type='button' value='Sign Up'>
</body>
</html>

Q4. Write a html code to Select country list box
For that we first cerate web page by opening and closing html key word and as we want to cerate element in body for that we are creating body by opening and closing body as here we are creating list box then first cerate text which select country then we have create list box  for that we have to use  select keyword like <select> open and close like </select>  here it will cerate list box and here we can add option here like then we have to use option keyword inside select like 
<select>
<table border='1'>
<option> sir</option>
<option> pak</option>
<option> aus</option>
</select>
We will option we have to add many option by opening and closing the option.
Q5. Write html cod to create a web table;
Sr. No	Book Type	Cost 
1	manual	100
2	SQL	200
3	Java	300

For to cerate web Table here is 4 rows and three column which include header like sr.No , book type and cost. Row one is table header. When ever there is table then fist row is readied then column.  And other row are conation table data.
To cerate this type webpage first we will cerate one webpage by using html keyword open and close then we add this table or element then we cerate body by opening and closing body. Here we are creating table then we have to use keyword Table <table> open and </table> close. 
To give border we use one attribute which is border=’value’  i.e. broder=’1’
i.e . <table border=’1’>

And here in between table we have to cerate  row like 
<tr> open and </tr> close here we open one row then first contain 3 columns  like sr. no, book type, and cost. All the columns are headers so for to enter table headers first we will open table header one i.e. <th> open and </th> and we have to give name of column in between this.
Like  
<th> Sr.No</th> 1st  column created at row no. 1
<th> Sr.No</th> 2nd column created at row no. 1
<th> Sr.No</th> 3rd  column created at row no. 1
To give border we use one attribute which is border=’value’  i.e. broder=’1’
i.e . <table border=’1’>
when first row is created the similarly we can cerate second row. Which included all table data. For this we have to open table row by using <tr> open and </tr> and in between we have to  give table data like <td> open and </td> close. And in between we can add table data like 
<tr> table row open 
<td>1</td>
<td>manual</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>  table row close.
Like that we can add all table data.


<html>
<body>
<table border='1'>
	<tr>
		<th>Sr No</th>
		<th>Book Type</th>
		<th>Cost</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>Manual</td>
		<td>100</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>SQL</td>
		<td>200</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>Java</td>
		<td>300</td>
	</tr>
	

</table>
</body>
</html>


We have to identify three parameters 
We have to identify  this three parameter on regular basis
1 .Tag Name
2. Attribute 
3. Text
We have to identify or find out  on which place tag name and attribute and text form html code 
1.	Tag Name: 
Any keyword which is present immediately after less than < symbol is called as Tag name.
<table border='1'> here table is tag Name
Only opening keyword after immediately < less that is Tag Name.
When ever open in html then it mandatory to close like body , title etc.

2.	Attribute: 
If we want to find attribute then we have to check for = sign if = is present then attribute is present otherwise attributes is not present.
Any keyword which is present after tag Name with equal to symbol until greater than symbol 
Syntax is 
Property name = ‘property value’
Attribute Name=’attribute value’
Left hand side consist attribute name and right hand consist attribute value.

3.	Text :
Any keyword which is present in between (>) greater than and (<) less than symbol is called as text.
Ex. 
>sr.No< 
>manual<
<option> aus</option>

Locator: 
By using locator we can find out address of webpage elements and when we find address of element  then we can perform action on that elements.
For finding addresses of web page element then we locator.
Locator are use to identify an element  with help of locator types.
Here are many locator types available by using one of them we can find out address of element 
In web driver here is 8 types of locator is available which are
1.	Tagname			>>tagname
2.	id				>> attribute value
3.	name  			>> attribute value
4.	classname			>> attribute value
5.	linkText			>>text
6.	 partial LinkText		>>text
7.	css				>>expression 
8.	xpath                              >>expression 
to identify an element present in web page we need to use “findelement ()” method which is present in webdriver.
If we want to find out address of element then first we have to use of findelement()  method which is present in webdriver.
Syntax for this is
Webdriverobjectname.findelement()
driver.findelement(By.) 
this method is use to find out the address of element.
Suppose if we want enter user name in Facebook in user name filed then first we have to find out the address of that element in web page for that we use findelement ().
driver.findelement(locator type)  we have pass any one locator out of 8 locator type in parenthesis by using locator type it can find address of element.
By class
This all 8 locator types are stored in By class which is present in selenium webdriver and all this locator are present in By class and all this 8 locator types  are present as static method in By class.
As its static method , then to use static method of different class then we use
DifferentClassName.methodName();
By.locatorName
By.xpath

In same way we can access this locators
Like 
Driver.findelement(By.xpath(“StringXpathExpression”)
Whenever we use xpath locator or xpath method then we have to pass the StringXpathExpression  input to this method. Like suppose if we have method(int a, int b) then while calling this method we have to pass to parameters which are int a value and int b value. we have to find string Xpath expression 
Xpath expression :
To find out xpath expression we have 6 different approaches available which are
1.	xpath by attribute   -- //tagname[@attributeName=’attribute value’]
2.	xpath by text           --//tagname[text()=’text value’]
3.	xpath by contains
1.	xpath by contains with text -- //tagname[contains(text(),’text value’)]
2.	xpath by contains with attributes --//tagname[contains(@ attributesName, ‘attribute 
value’)]
4.  xpath by index –(multiple matching xpath xperssion ) [index]
5. absolute xpath
6. relative xpath 

1.	xpath by attribute   -- //tagname[@attributeName=’attribute value’]
by using xpath by attribute we can find xpath expression and by using this xpath expression we can find out address of eleemnts. 
Here is one formula to find out xpath by attribute which is

 // tagname[@attributeName=’attribute value’]

By using this formula we can find out xpath expression.
To execute this formula we need 
1.	tagname –  keyword immediately after < 
2.	attributeName – when = is present then left side of = sign is
3.	attributvalue – when = is present then after = right hand side is attribute value
we can get this from webpage  
for that  we have to inspect on web page by click right mouse button then click on window plus arrow sign present at left side and then select filed on which address we want then it automatically show the html code for that in blue colour highlights.
<input type="text" class="inputtext _55r1 _6luy" name="email" id="email" data-testid="royal_email" placeholder="Email address or phone number" autofocus="1" aria-label="Email address or phone number">
And from this we have to find tagname and attribute name and attribute values.
Here tagname is input and here are many attributes and attributes values are available so we can select any one from it. Name ,id, placeholder we wave to select one of this. name=’email’. Double click on attribute value and copy it b’coz some time attribute value is larger in size .
We have to apply formula on this inspects window by using  ctrl+f  then we see small window then we have to write our formula i.e. //input[@name=’email’] then if our formula is correct or match then it will show 1of1 and then highlight address and after click on that code we will see  email id section get highlighted.
Then copy this formula and paste in our script like
Driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input[@name=’email’])
Here we find address of email or user name then we have to perform action on that for that we .sendkeysmethod() is used to pass input In elements.  And give input in ” ” double quote like.
Driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input[@name=’email’]).sendkeys(“saurav@gamil.com”);
When we run then this input is enter in elements.
For password also we have to find addresses of password filed or element then copy that password formula and paste in scripts 
Driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input[@name=’email’]).sendkeys(“saurav@gamil.com”);
Driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input [@id='pass']”)]).sendkeys(“saurav@457”);
For click login button then we have to .click method to click button
driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input[@name=’email’]).sendkeys(“saurav@gamil.com”);
driver.findelement(By.xpath(“//input [@id='pass']”)]).sendkeys(“saurav@457”);
driver.findelemnet(By.xpath(“//button[@name='login']”)).click();

2.	xpath by  text : [//tagname[text()=’text value’]
suppose if we want to click on forgotten password link then we have to find address of that link by using HTML code by using Tagname and attribute but when attribute is not available or its invalid attribute means its value is too lengthy then we use other approaches which is findElements by using text
Text is present between the >  text < means in between greater than and less than sign.
Expression or formula for text is 
//tagname[text()=’text value’]
 Where tagname : keyword after immediately after less than sign < keyword  is called tagname.
Text () : is text function use it as it is.
Text value : is value of text copy it and use it.
driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//tagname[text()=’text value’]”)).click ();
driver.findElements(By.xpath(‘’ //a[text()='Forgotten account?']”)).click();


if text is hide … like this way then double click on that we will see the text. If text is hidden >…< in this way.
3.	Xpath by contains 
1.	Xpath by contains with attributes:
Xpath by contains is use suppose attribute is present for one of elements but length of that attribute is too large then we can use xpath by contains attribute. By using this we use small portion of that attribute value and use this small portion or part to find out address of elements 
Formula for xpath by contains with attributes 
//tagname[contains(@attributeName,’attribut value’)]
Here  
tagname: keyword immediately after < than sign <keyword is called tagname
contains: as it is
attributeName: left side of = sign is called attribute name.
attribute value: is partial or small part of attribute value is use.
like 
driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//tagname[contains(@attribute”,’attribute value’)])).click();
driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//input[contains(@class,'inputtext _1kbt')]”)).sendkeys(“saurav”);

2.	Xpath by contains with text :
When we have elements where attributes are not available but text Is available but length of text is larger then we can use small portion or part of text value and by using this we can find address in this case we use xpath by contains with text.

Formula for xpath by contains with text is
//tagname[contains(text(),’text value’)]
Here tagname:
contains : as it is
text(): text function as it is.
text  value: substring , small part of text value .
like 
driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//tagname[contains(text(),’text value’]”)).click();
driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//a[contains(text(),'Forgotten ')]”)).click();


4.  xpath by index –(multiple matching xpath expression ) [index]
Suppose if we found address of elements but when its show many address like 1 of 7 then when we run the scripts with this elements address then by default selenium will run first matching address but our desired address is matching with 2nd or third matching address then we use xpath by index approach to find out address of elements. 
Formula from xpath by index is
(multiple matching xpath expression )[index]
(//input[@type='text']) [2]
Here we have to add expressions() and we have to give index value in[] at which number our desired element address is highlighted.

5. Absolute xpath
We don’t use this to find out address of xpath 
Suppose we have web page have many elements like un, pass. email, etc.
 
Here web page and Html code is given so if we want to find out absolute xpath then first by using tis page code we have draw tree diagram  from html code by using tag name we can draw tag name.
html is parent for all and its immediate child is body then body have three child which are div[1],div[2] and div[3] and in each div have its own child. div [1] have three child by using tag name we can create tree diagram , div[2] have three child, and div[3] have three child
 
Immediate child are use to find absolute xpath and to identify the same tag name we have to give index like [1],[2] .. etc in front of them.
Absulte xpath is used to navigate from root of the parents’ to immediate child. 
By using the absolute xpath we can jump from parent of immediate child.
To achieve absolute xpath we need to use single froward slash(/).
By using forward (/) we jump to immediate child.
 Like 
Suppose if we want find xpath for User name by using the absolute xpath then we don’t directly use the User name from that we have to add parents then we have to go for immediate child body  then we to go to immediate child div[1], then we have to go to immediate child input[1]
User name : /html/body/div[1]/input[1]
Contact:/html/body/div[2]/input[3]
Login:/html/body/div[3]/button
Disadvantages of absolute xpath:
1)	Xpath is too lengthy and time consuming
2)	Identifying of an element by developing html tree diagram is difficult. Means here we have to make tree diagram so it will take too much time.

6. Relative xpath
In relative xpath also we have to  draw tree diagram.
In relative xpath we use // double forward slash.
In relative xpath we can jump from parent to any child.
Suppose if we want find xpath for 
1.	User name : //div[1]//input[1]  or //div[1]/input[1]
2.	Contact: //div[2]//input[3] or //div[2]/input[3]
3.	Login : //div[3]//button or //div[3]/button or //button
Disadvantages of relative xpath:
Identifying of an element by developing html tree diagram is difficult. Means here we have to make tree diagram so it will take too much time.

Difference between the
/ is use to navigate from root of parent to immediate child.

// is use to navigate from root of parent to any child.
1.	Tagname			>>tagname
2.	id				>> attribute value
3.	name  			>> attribute value
4.	classname			>> attribute value
5.	linkText			>>text
6.	 partial LinkText		>>text
7.	css				>>expression 
this locators are not use in mostly.
Because it have some limitations.
1.	Tagname  >> tagname 
Suppose if we want to find the address of elements by using tagname then there is 
Sysntax is 
objectname.findeElement(By.tagname(“input”))
when we use tagname locator then we can pass inputs in that field for that we use tagname.
But when in html code two field have same duplicate  tagname then we cant use this tag name locator because compiler start from line by line and it will perform action on first elements.

Disadvantage of tagname locator:
 If in webpage if multiple elements are present with same tagname and we use tagname locatortype to identify an elements then selenium will perform action on 1st present only.
If tag name is duplicate then we have to use of id locator.
2.	 id    << attribute value
to find out the address of elements we can id locator if attribute is present in html code.
Syntax for that is
objectname.findElement(By.id(‘’value”))
by using it we can perform action on elements.
But if two elements in html code have same id value then at this time compiler will perform action of first element only.
When we use id locator ?
When id locator is present and id attribute value is unique then we can use id locator.
When we cant use id locator ?
If the id locator is not present and if multiple elements have same id value then we can use id locator because we cant add index infront  of this locator.

When we cant use id locator then we will class (classname)

3.	 Classname >> attribute value
By using classname we can find address of elements and then we can perform action on that elements. Its name is class but while reading we use as classname
Syntax is 
objectname.findElement(By.class(“value”))

when  classname have duplicate value then it will perform action first element only.

where we can use classname locator?
When class attribute is available and having unique attributes value then we can use classname attribute.

Where we cant use classname locator?
When is the class attribute is not present and class attributes have same value.

If classname attribute is not present or valid then we will move to next locator that is.

4.name   >>attribute value
We also find address of elements by using name attributes and we canperfrom action on elements.
ObjectName.findElement(By.name(“value”))

If the name attribute value is duplicate then compiler is perform action on first matching elements.
When we use name locator ?
When name locator is present and have unique value then we can use name locator.

When we cant use name locator?
When name locator is not present and name locator have duplicate values.

5.  linktext   >>text 
 We can find address of elements or to perform action on link  by using linktext attribute and we can perform operation. For that we have to use text present in link like >text< .  like as it’s a link so we can only click on that link
Syntax is 
ObjectName.findElemet(By.linktText(“text present in link”)

 By using linkText we have to enter entire text value then it will perform action on that text matching Elements.

6. Partiallink Text  <<text
Partial link Text is used to perform action on link when we use partial link text then by using partial text we can perform action on that element or link.
Syntax of partial link text is:
objectName.findElements(By.partiallinkText(“partial or small part of text available in link text”))

here we can use partial or small part of text to use to perform action on link.

7. CSS  <<expressions
CSS is also have there expression like xpath
We either use Xpath or CSS here we are using Xpath

In our company we don’t use CSS use Xpath in our company.

Types of locators are ?
There are 8 types of locator.

Types of Xpath ?
There are two types of xpath
1)	Absolute xpath
2)	Relative xpath 
we are use relative xpath to find xpath expression of xpath. 
All that xpath by attribute
Xpath by text 
Xpath by contains 
Xpath by index 
Are under in relative xpath because by using // we can jump to any child from root of parents.
In CSS and Xpath which is fast?
Then CSS is faster than xpath for few second. But by using Xpath we find appropriate address.

 
WebDriver is interface which is use to perform actions on browser like to open browser, enter  URL, close , perform navigation like back, forward , refresh.
Web elements methods 
WebElement: it is an interface use to perform action on element present in a browser(webapplication).

WebElement methods:

1. Sendkeys(): 
	This method is use to enter value in the input/text field
 This method is use to enter input in text filed. For that first we have to find out address of elements the we can perform action that.
Like suppose if its user name text box then by using this method we can enter user name  in it.
Like
Objectname.findElement(By.xpath(“//tagname[@attribute=’value”).sendkeys(“basabs”);
findElement() method is WebDriver method and its return types is WebElement. Here this method is returning the WebElement means whenever we call findElement method then it will return address in form of WebElement. WebElement is interface it find out address of element and store it in WebElement it returns the address. When we call findElement method then pass Xpath expression as input and it find out address of element and return WebElement.
When call this findElement method then we can store this method because method which returning some output then we can store this types of method.
We can directly perform action on WebElement method by using sendKeys() which use to enter input text in text filed 
Like
Objectname.findElement(By.xpath(“//tagname[@attribute=’value’]”).sendKeys(“abc”);
Or 2nd approach we also store findElement method in object or variable because it returning some value.
Like 
WebElement s=Objectname.findElement(By.xpath(“//tagname[@attribute=’value’”);
n.sendKeys(“abc”);
we can call findElement method this type also.
Here we find address of element and store it into object and then by using that object name we perform action on that element.
Both approaches are correct.
What is the  return type of findElement method ?
WebElement 


2. Clear():
	This method is use to clear value in the text field.
 This method is use to clear value in text filed.
Suppose if we have condition like we have to enter text value in text field and we want discard or it and we have enter new value there here we are performing multiple operation on single element.
//		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id='email']")).sendKeys("abc");
//		Thread.sleep(2000); // for to wait 
//		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id='email']")).clear();
//		Thread.sleep(2000);
//		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id='email']")).sendKeys("xyz");
		
		WebElement UN = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@id='email']"));		
		UN.sendKeys("abc");
		Thread.sleep(2000);
		UN.clear();
		Thread.sleep(2000);
		UN.sendKeys("xyz");
Here when we have to perform multiple operation on same element then we use 2nd approach i.e. 
Storing findElement() method into object and performing action on that object.
Like 
WebElement a=objectname.findElement(//tagname[@attribute=’value’);
a.sendKey(“asa”);
a.clear();
a.sendKey(“dsa”);


3. Click(): 
	Click method is use to click on buttons, links also use to select radio buttons & checkboxes.

4. getText: 
	This method is use to get text present in a webpage.
	Return type of getText function is String.
 Suppose if we want print text present in element then we use getText()
Like 
String text =objectname.findElement(“”).getText();
Syso(text);
Here first we find out address of element then we use getText method to get text method from element.
Here getText method is string return type method so we have to store it into object.
Mostly text is present in links and button element.

We have to verify that this text is present or not for that we use get text method.


5. isEnabled(): 
	This method is use to verify element is enabled or disabled.
        Return type of isenabled function boolean
        if element is enabled then it returns true otherwise it returns false.
 This method is use to find that that one of the element is enable or disable. Enable means we can perform action on that and disable means we can’t perform action on that. Some of the elements are disable until we perform action some required element first then only it can enable to perform operation on that element.
Suppose if we want to check is login button is enable or not then we have to address of login button then we can verify is it enable or not.
 isenabled() method is returning Boolean value like true or false. 

Like 
	boolean result = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//button[text()='Log in']")).isEnabled();
		System.out.println(result);
Here we store isEnabled method in object because it is returning boolean value here we store address of element and isEnabled its return true or false and we are string it on to object which result and printing that object in printing statement.
if (result==true) 
		{
			System.out.println("Element is enabled");
		}
		else 
		{
			System.out.println("Element is disabled");			
		}
		If we get result is equal to true then it will return element is enable but if result is false then it execute else part and we see result like element is disabled.
isEnabled():
•	The isEnabled() method is used to check if an element on a web page is enabled or not.
•	It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on the element's enabled state.
•	An element is considered enabled if it is interactive and can receive user input, such as clicking or typing.
•	If the element is disabled or not interactive, the isEnabled() method will return false.

6. isDisplayed(): 
	This method is use to verify element is present or not.
	Return type of isDisplayed function is boolean.
	if element is present then it returns true otherwise it returns false.
This method is used to check that one of the elements is present on UI or not for this purpose we use isDisplayed() method like suppose if it’s facebook login page then we have to check that is facebook logo is present or not then we use this method which isDisplayed() if its present then we will pass this script otherwise fail. (Sometime while performing testing manually some elements are present but while performing automation some elements are seen or visible. In the case of automation is this element is present or not then we use isDisplayed method). 
This method return the boolean values like true or false. As this method is returning value then we have to use 
boolean  n=driver.findElement(by.xpath(“//img[@class='fb_logo _8ilh img']")).isDisplayed();
syso(n); //true if present or false if not present 
we can also use if else to show message like
if(result==true)
		{
			System.out.println("Element found");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("Element not found");
		}
isDisplayed():
•	The isDisplayed() method is used to check if an element is displayed or visible on the web page.
•	It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on the element's visibility.
•	An element is considered displayed if it is rendered on the page and visible to the user.
•	If the element is hidden or not currently visible, the isDisplayed() method will return false.

7. isSelected(): 
	This method is use to verify radio button/checkbox is selected or not.
 	Return type of isSelected function is Boolean.
	if radio button/checkbox is selected then it returns true otherwise it returns false.
This  method return the boolean then we have to store it in variable and then we can use actions on that element plus print also.
Like 
boolean result = driver.findElement(By.xpath("(//input[@class='_8esa'])[1]")).isSelected();
		System.out.println(result);
And by using if else we can we can show message if result gets true then it show radio button is selected if we get false then button is not selected and by default on facebook site radio button is not selected.
		
		if (result==true)
		{
			System.out.println("radio btn selected");
		}
		else 
		{
			System.out.println("radio btn de-selected");
		}
•	The isSelected() method is primarily used with form elements like checkboxes, radio buttons, or select options.
•	It checks if the element is selected or not, particularly in the case of checkboxes or radio buttons.
•	It returns a boolean value (true or false) based on the element's selection state.
•	If the element is selected or checked, the isSelected() method will return true. If it is not selected or unchecked, it will return false

new version of selenium
selenium 4.6.0
this new version of selenium is very easy to use just download it and configure with our java project here we don’t have need to download the drivers of browser  and we don’t have need to check the version of browser we can simply use it by configure with java project 
and now we don’t have need to use System.setProperty(“webdriver.chrome.driver”,” E:\selenium\webdriver\chromedriver.exe”); this which use for to give name or browser and path that browser driver.
In new version we can simply perform option on browser by just creating object 
1.	Approach 1
ChromeDriver n= new ChromeDriver();
2.	Approach 2
WebDriver n = new ChromeDriver();
Collection 

Collection is used to overcomes the drawbacks of arrays.
Collection is interface which is available in Java.Util packages it includes of three interface which are 1st List() interface, 2nd Set () interface and is Queue () interface.
And all sub interface have there own implementation classes.
Like 
1.	List interface have three implementation classes  
which are 
1.	 ArrayList is an implementation class for List interface.
2.	Vector implementation class for List interface.
3.	LinkedList is implementation class for List interface

2.	Set interface also have three implementation classes which are 

1.	hashSet is implementation class for Set interface 
2.	LinkedHashset is implementation class for Set interface
3.	TreeSet is implementation class for Set interface
3.  Queue interface have one implementation class which is priorityQueue
 All seven  implementation class of collection are used to store data.
Arrays has limitation like in array we can only store homogenous (same type )data  and arrays have fix size.
Collection is used to overcomes the drawbacks of array.
When we used collection then we don’t have to specify the capacity and by using collection we can store heterogeneous(different types of data / combination of all type of data) data in  one object.
In collection object we can store as many data in it but when we cerate object of array we have to specify the range or size arrays and we can store data in between that range.
In collection we have 7 implementation class which are
1.	ArrayList 
2.	Vector 
3.	LinkedList 
4.	hashset
5.	LinkedHashset
6.	TreeSet  
7.	priorityQueue 
All this classes are predefined classes in java 


 
1.	List interface of collection 
Features of List sub interface which are
1.	Duplicate are allowed in List. Means we can store duplicate value in List interface like suppose we have Rahul , Rahul two or many times so  we can store it as many time.
2.	Allow any number of null values.  Means suppose we don’t have value available at time while creating object then by using  null values means we can reverse space for any value which want store at that place later so when data is available then we store that data on that null place or reserve space.
3.	Storage type is index.  means in which format we are storing data in collection means we are storing data in the format of index. means wherever we add first data then is initial index value is 0 and last value length-1 means suppose we store 10 data then starting index is 0 and end index is 9.
4.	Order of insertion is maintained.  Means we can store data in sequentially or serial vies
Suppose if we want to book movie ticket then suppose five people waiting in queue then we have stand after 5th person we cant enter in between 5 to 1. Means we have to follow the order here also we follow the order means first data which we sent is store at 0th index then 1st then 2nd in this way.
All this feature are applicable on all three implementation class of List interface 
1.	ArrayList
2.	Vector
3.	LinkedList 
1. ArrayList  implementation class
Features of ArrayList 
1.	Default/initial  capacity of ArrayList is 10. 
 Means whenever we cerate object of ArrayList then 10 index are available there by default and we can store many data or larger than 10 also.
 
All this 7 classes are predefined classes means we can create object of This classes and we can use the features  and methods of this classes.
 Whenever we create object of ArrayList then <> comes automatically.
Cerate object of ArrayList like
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
al.add(101); // add is non-static method available in ArrayList to add data into object 
al.add(“Rahul”); // when we want to add string value then “”  double quotation marks are 
mandatory 
        al.add(‘A’);  // when enter char then ‘ ‘ single quotation marks are mandatory
         al.add(65.05f) // float value
         al.add(null) ; // null value
suppose if we want print all data in ArrayList then use 
System.out.println(al); // it will print all data 
Suppose if we add duplicate data like
	al.add(“Rahul”);
	al.add(101); 
Then this data is added after null means at 5th and 6th index 
2.	Duplicates values are allowed in ArrayList. Means  duplicated values  are allowed.
Suppose if we add duplicate data like
	al.add(“Rahul”);
	al.add(101); 
Then this data is added after null means at 5th and 6th index 

3.	We can add any number of null values.  Means we can add multiple null values 
Like 
al.add(null);
al.add(null);
any number of duplicate null values are allowed.
4.	Storage type is index.
Means data is stored in index format.
5.	Order of insertion maintained.
 Means data which we sent are stored in that order means order is  maintained here.

6.	Incremental capacity = (current capacity *3/2)+1 =16.
Means when capacity of ArrayList is full i.e. 10 and when try to add more data in it ArrayList automatically / internally  apply this formula like (current capacity *3/2)+1 =16 then we will get 16 index and when and more data in it then it will again increases capacity like (16*3/2)+1=25 like this by applying this formula it will increases the index capacity.
7.	Data structure is resizable.
Every implementation class have data structure. And  ArrayList data structure is resizable. Means initial capacity is by default 10 but we can change this also like
ArrayList n= new ArrayList(8);
Now default value is 8 now but its not fix  we can decrease capacity also whenever we add new data in it. It will internally apply formula which is (current capacity*3/2)+1. i.e. (8*3/2)+1=13.
8.	Best choice : means where to use ArrayList
Retrieval operations (RandomAccess Interface is implemented in ArrayList and vector). ArrayList is best choice for Retrieval operation (means fetch / get data) because in collection there is interface available called as RandomAccess and its features are implemented only in ArrayList and Vector completed there and this RandomAccess interface have some special features by using it we can fetch lots of data in less time.
9.	ArrayList is worst choice for data manipulation
 (means suppose if we are adding or inserting data or removing data in between ArrayList then in this case right shift and left shift operation is perform in ArrayList. Suppose if we have 1000 or many data available then in this case this right and left shift operation take too much time. When we have to perform manipulation operation then we don’t use ArrayList.
10.	ArrayList is not legacy Class.
Methods of ArrayList
1.	Size()
Suppose if we want to check size of ArrayList means how much data is stored in ArrayList then There is method available for that i.e. size()
Call this method like 
Syntax is:
obejctName.size()
System.out.println(objectName.size());
System.out.println(al.size()); // it will return size of ArrayList means all elements present in object 
which is 7
2.	isEmpty()
suppose if we want know is ArrayList is empty or having some data then we use isEmpty()
syntax is
objectName.isEmpty()
System.out.println(al. isEmpty() ());
System.out.println(al. isEmpty() ()); // here we get false because data is present
3.	contains()
suppose if we want check that is one of data is present in our ArrayList or not then we use ArrayList.
System.out.println(al.contains(“Rahul”)); // here we get true because is present here.
4.	get(index)()
suppose if we want print data on one of index then we use get(index) ()
syso(al.get(1); // here we get Rahul because Rahul is present at 1st index 

5.	add(index, element) ()
if we want to add information or data in between ArrayList then we use method add(index, element). suppose if we want to store data in between existing index like suppose we add data at 0 to 7 index but we want to add data at 4 index then we use add(index, elements) () method.
Syntax is 
ObejctName.add(index, element);
al.add(4,105);
here we perform this then new data is added at 4 index and existing data is shifted at 5th index, data after that is shifted at 6th index like this way When we add data in between ArrayList then its perform Right Shift operation.
When we add data in between then it data is shifted right side.
Suppose if there us queue for ticket book 10 people are already there but if new person is get into that and take 5 place then person who will standing on 5th position is shifted to 6th to till end.
 
6.	remove(index)
When we want remove /delete data in between ArrayList then we use remove(index).
Suppose if we want to remove data at 4th index then we use remove(index), it will remove data at 4th index. when we remove data in between of ArrayList then it performs left shift operation.
Syntax is
objectName.remove(index);
al.remove(4); / it will remove the data at 4th index
here when we remove data from  in between ArrayList then then data at that index is get remove and data after That  take its index means data is shifted left side.
Suppose 10 people are waiting in line then person who is 5th position have some and when he leave that line then automatically person who is on 6th place will take his place.
 
7.	set(index, element)
When we want to update / modify  any data present in ArrayList then we use set(index, element) () method.
 Suppose if we want update data of 2 index that is percentage i.e. 65.54f to 75.65f then we use set(index, element)
Like 
ObejctName.set(index, element);
al.set(2,75.89f); // it will update information at 2nd index 
Suppose if we gets marks 50 and we thinks that the marks which we get is less than our expectations and we apply for recheck and we get our updated marks like 65.
 When we use System.out.println(al i.e. ArrayList obejctname); then it not printing values of ArrayList it only showing the in square bracket means which data is present in our object.
When we want print/fetch  data then we have use Cursor to print data of ArrayList.
The object which we are creating is storing in special area memory.

2.	Vector
Vector is very first Class of 
 ArrayList and Vector have most of have same features only three points are different.
Vector Have some features Available.
1. Default capacity for Vector is 10.means when we use or create object of vector then default capacity is 10 which is not fix when we add data then vector index capacity is increases automatically.
	2. duplicate are allowed in vector
	3. Allows any no of null values
	4. Storage type: index
	5. Order of insertion-maintain 	
	*6. Incremental capacity = current capacity*2. Means when vector index default capacity is full then it will apply this formula which is (current capacity*2) internally. Means when default capacity get full then it will increase capacity by 2 or double the current capacity.
	*7. data structure: doubly. doubly means whenever data is getting double means whenever default capacity get full then vector use formula which is Current Capacity *2 it doubling the current capacity.	
	8. best choice: retrieval operation  (random access interface is implemented in arraylist & vector)
	9. worst choice: manipulation operation i.e. insertion in between Vector or delete  ()
	*10. Vector is legacy class.  means vector is First developed implementation class in Collection i.e. it called as legacy class or Old class.
11. we can add additional cursor called as enumerations.

 We can fetch and show all data in vector by following ArrayList steps and additional is we use enumeration cursor also.
Syntax of vector is 
Vector ObejctName=new Vector();
 
By using objectName we can perform all operation like arraylist. 
1.	We can add data in vector object by calling add () method is non-static method  we can add heterogenous data in vector because its an implementation class or List interface which is sub interface of collection.
Syntax is
objectName.add(data which we want add); 
2.	By using printing statement we can show data present in vector object like
Syso(objectName);
Vector have some methods also

1.	isempty() :
this method is use to show that data is present  in vector or not. if data is present then it show false otherwise true.
Syntax 
Syso(objectName.isempty());
1.	get(index)
When we want to print data of specific index of vector then we use get(index) () method.
Syntax 
Syso(objectName.get(indexVAlue);
2.	size()
when we want find length/size of vector mean how many data is present in vector then we called size() method.
syntax
syso(ObejctName.size());
3.	contains()
when we want to check one of data is present in vector or not then we use contains ()method.
syntax
syso(objectname.contains(data which want to check));
4.	add(index, element)()
when we want to add data in between of vector then we use add(index, element) () method. when we add data in between vector we have to give index number at which index we want add new and new data we want to add then it shifted data right hand side or perform right shift operation.
syntax
ObjectName.add(index, element));

5.	remove(index) ()
when we want to remove in between data of vector then we use remove(index) method. when we call this method this method will remove data of that index and when we use this method then left shift operation is performed means data is shifted at lefthand side.
Syntax
objectName.remove(index);

6.	set(index, element)()
when we want update existing data present  in vector then we set (index, element) here we have give index number at which index data we want to update and information we want to add or update. 
Syntax
ObejectName.set(index,element);

We can print/fetch data  of vector by using
1.	iterator
2.	ListIterator
3.	for loop
4.	for each loop
5.	enumeration 

1.	iterator 
by using we can fetch data of vector like
syntax is 
Iterator onejctname=vectorObjectname.iterator();
while(objectame.hashNext())
{
Syso(objectNAme.next();
}
It will print all data which is present in vector

2.	ListIterator 
Syntax 
ListIterator ObjectName =vectorobjectName.listIterator(); 
while(objectName.hashNext())
{
Syso(objectname.next());
}
Here we can print all data in vector.

3.	for loop
for(int i=0;i<=vectorobjectname.size()-1;i++)
{
Syso(vectorobjectname(i));
}
We can print all data in vector by using the for loop
4.	for each loop
for (Object variablename:vectorobjecname)
{
Syso(variablename);
}
Here we can also print all data of vector.
3. LinkedList
Is  a third implementation Class of of List sub interface of collection.
In LinkedList we can store heterogenous data.
It have it own features like
	*1. No Default capacity. 
Means whenever we declare LinkedList then by default don’t reserve any default indexes here is no any default capacity like Vector or ArrayList like how much data we want to store it it simply store in it suppose if we store 8 data in it then now current capacity 8 means here now default indexes are available in LinkedList. And if we add more data or remove in it then it will simply again it store data / remove capacity will change again.
	2. duplicate are allowed in LinkedList.
	3. allows any no of null values
	4. order of insertion-maintain
	5. storage type: index
	*6. data structure: linear.
	Linear means whenever we add data in LinkedList then it consist of two index which is 1st is previous index and 2nd is next index.  all information is not stored in one object all information is store in small small object and it consist of previous and next index and all this small index are connected connected to each other by next index to previous index. and we can access only previous index only like if we want print Rahul then we can only use 0th index for print Rahul. Like train boxes are connected to each other like that same way all this small object all connected to each other by previous and next index is called data structure linear.
 
Suppose if we add data like Rahul then it consist  of two index values 1st is 0 and 2nd is 1. And we add another data like 100 and it also  consist of two index which are  1st index is 1 and second index is 2. And suppose we add 3rd information like 65.45 then this also consists of two index first if 2 and 2nd is 3. Here all small object are connect to each other by using next index and previous index like 100 is connect to Rahul by using 100s previous index and Rahul next index like same way all connect to each other by using next index and previous index.

	*7. best choice: manipulation operation   i.e. insertion in between linkedlist or delete()
LinkedList is best choice for data manipulation means when ever we add or remove in between data in LinkedList because here no any data shifting operation is not performed only index values of information is updated so it will take less time. But in case of shifting then data is shifted from one place to another then it will take more time. When we have information where we want to add or remove in between then we must have to use LinkedList.
	*8. worst choice: retrieval operation (random access interface is not implemented).
Here in LinkedList is worst choice in the case of data retrieval because in LinkedList Random access interface is not implemented. As Random Access interface have some special features by using that we can fetch data in less time but this random Access interface is not implemented in LinkedList.  So in case of data retrieval LinkedList best worst choice. (Suppose if we want print data present at 10th  index  then it will search till to 10th index is present or not. but when we use ArrayList or vector and we want print data present on 10th index it will print directly.)
Difference between ArrayList and vector

	   ArrayList		|	Vector
	1. not legacy class	|	legacy class

	2. DS: resizable		|	DS: doubly

	3. I.C=(C.C.*3/2)+1	|	IC=CC*2

      	  4. performance: high		|  performance: low


Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
ArrayList 	LinkedList
1.	Default capacity is 10	LinkedList don’t have any default capacity 
2.	Data structure is resizable 	Data structure of LinkedList is Linear.
3.	ArrayList is best choice for Retrieval of data 	LinkedList is best choice for data manipulation 
4. ArrayList is worst choice for data manipulation 	LinkedList is worst choice for data retrieval.


Methods used in LinkedList 
1 add()
This method is used to add data in LinkedList object.
Synatx
ObjectName.add();

2.	isempty() :
this method is use to show that data is present  in LinkedList or not. if data is present then it show false otherwise true.
Syntax 
Syso(objectName.isempty());
7.	get(index)
When we want to print data of specific index of LinkedList then we use get(index) () method.
Syntax 
Syso(objectName.get(indexVAlue);
8.	size()
when we want find length/size of LinkedList mean how many data is present in LinkedList then we called size() method.
syntax
syso(ObejctName.size());
9.	contains()
when we want to check one of data is present in LinkedList or not then we use contains ()method.
syntax
syso(objectname.contains(data which want to check));
10.	add(index, element)()
when we want to add data in between of LinkedList then we use add(index, element) () method. when we add data in between LinkedList we have to give index number at which index we want add new and new data we want add then that data will be store at that place no right shift operation is perform. Here suppose if we want store new value on 2nd index then pointer between 1st index and 2nd index is get break and is connected to new information which we want add at 2nd index this new information contains two index value which  is 2 and 3 and this new information is connected to information which present previously that 2nd index only index value of that information is change to 3 and 4 and after that information index value also change no any data is shifted from it palace only there index values are changing.
 

syntax
ObjectName.add(index, element));

11.	remove(index) ()
when we want to remove in between data of LinkedList then we use remove(index) method. when we call this method this method will remove data of that index when we perform remove operation then data is remove from that index but no any information is shifted from it places in liknedlist all data is store in small small objects and they are connected to each other and when we remove any data then data at that index is get remove and pointer is break and connect to next data after that and only index values are updated previous and next index values is updated no any data is shifted from its place.
objectName.remove(index);
 

12.	set(index, element)()
when we want update existing data present  in LinkedList then we set (index, element) here we have give index number at which index data we want to update and information we want to add or update. 
Syntax
ObejectName.set(index,element);


To print data of LinkedList we can use two cursors
1.	Iterator
2.	ListIterator 
And we can print data of LinkedList by using
1.	For loop
2.	Each for loop
1.	Iterator cursor to print data of LinkedList
Iterator obejectName= LinkedListObjectName.iterator(); // here store data of LinkedList into 
Iterator Object.
	While(obejctName.hasNext())
		{
		Syso(objectName.next();
		}
2.	ListIterator cursor for printing data of LinkedList
ListIterator ObjectName=LinkedListObjectName.listIterator();
while(objectName.hasNext())
{
Syso(ObjectName.next();
}
3.	LinkedList data printing by for Loop
for(int i=0;i<=LinkedListObjectName.size()-1;i++)
{
Syso(LinkedListObjectName.get(i));
}

4.	LinkedList data print by using for each loop
For(Object VariableName : LinkedListObjectName)
{
Syso(VariableName);
}
Cursor 
When we store data in collection then to print that data we use cursor. By using cursor we can fetch /print data of collection. 
We have three types of cursor by using any one we can print data of collection.
 
 There are three types of cursor
1.	Iterator 
2.	ListIterator
3.	Enumeration  
1. Iterator 
By using iterator we can print /store/fetch data of data of all seven implementation class.
Iterator cursor is called as universal cursor by using it we can fetch /store/ print data of all seven class of collection.
•	The Iterator interface provides methods to traverse a collection in a forward direction and perform various operations on its elements.
•	It allows you to check if the collection has more elements, retrieve the next element, and remove elements during iteration.
•	The Iterator is commonly used with the Collection framework, including classes like ArrayList, LinkedList, and HashSet.
•	Some important methods of the Iterator interface include hasNext(), next(), and remove()

2. ListIterator 
 By using ListIterator we can store/print / fetch data of only three implementation class of List only which are ArrayList , LinkedList and Vector.
ListIterator:
•	The ListIterator interface is a sub-interface of Iterator and extends its functionality to allow bidirectional traversal of a list.
•	It provides additional methods to traverse a list in both forward and backward directions, as well as modify the list during iteration.
•	ListIterator is primarily used with List implementations like ArrayList and LinkedList.
•	Some key methods of the ListIterator interface include hasNext(), next(), hasPrevious(), previous(), add(), set(), and remove().

3. Enumeration 
By using enumeration we can only fetch /store /print data of legacy class or Vector class. only one class.
All classes which are available in collection they all are developed in different version of Java in every version of java some classes are developed like in version one one class is developed then in 2nd next class is developed like that there all classes are developed till version 8 of java.
Enumeration:
•	The Enumeration interface is an older interface that was part of the original Java collections framework.
•	It provides a way to iterate over elements in legacy collections like Vector and Hashtable.
•	Enumeration has fewer methods compared to Iterator, with basic operations like checking if there are more elements and retrieving the next element.
•	 Some essential methods of the Enumeration interface include hasMoreElements() and nextElement()

The class which are developed in first version of java is called as legacy /old  class which Vector.
Which is legacy /old class in collection?
Vector because in developed in first version of java which is the oldest class in java.

Print/fetch  data of ArrayList by using iterator cursor.
 There are three types of cursor 
1.	Iterator – fetch data of all class
2.	ListIterator – fetch data of List implantation classes only there classes ArrayList, LinkedList and Vector.
3.	Enumeration – fetch data of vector only.

First approach to print data of ArrayList by using  iterator 

Here we have to copy all data of ArrayList object into iterator then we can fetch data one by one from iterator. To copy that we use 
Iterator objectName=ArrayListObjectName.iteartor();   // it will store all that of object in iterator which 
type is iterator 
iterator itr=al.iterator(); // when we call this it copy all data or ArrayList into itr object 

here ArrayList object will store or copy all data in iterator and we want to fetch data from that then we have to store it into one object and datatype or type is iterator its interface here data is store in object and its iterator type object.
iterator itr=al.iterator(); // when we call this it copy all data or ArrayList into itr object  of iterator 
To fetch data from iterator we have use while loop. Here while loop work like if condition is true which is given in () then only compiler will enter in while body. 
While()
{
}
 Here we give condition like here we check that is the data is present on 0th index of iterator is the data is present then compiler will return true then we can fetch that data. 
Iterator method :
1.	hashnext()
Here we give condition to check is data is present at iterator or not we use iteratorObjectName. hashnext(). 
Use of hashnext()  function is used to check that is data is present at starting index or 0th index or not if data is present then it will return.
2.	Next()
To print /fetch  data we use iterator next() method. next() method print data.
 And If true value is return then compiler will enter while loop body and print data present at 0th index then we use iteratorobejctName.next() method like
while(iteratorobjectname.hashNext())
{
System.out.println(iteratorobjectname.next());
}
while(itr.hashNext())
{
System.out.println(itr.next());
}
Here next method print data present at 0th index i.e. Rahul after printing one data compiler will check is next data is present at 1st index if data is present then compiler will true condition then it will again enter in while loop body and next () method will print data at 1st index this process is till continue until hashnext get false result then execution is stop and we will get all data printed which is present in iterator object.
2nd approach to print data of ArrayList by using  ListIterator 
If we want print data of ArrayList by using ListIterator. The we use
ListIterator obejectName=  ArrayListObjectName.ListIterator(); 
 Here ArrayListObjectName.ListIterator this copy all data of ArrayList in ListIterator and here by using this we are fetching data from it and type of Listiterator is ListIterator  so we have to store it into object and type of object is ListIterator.
ListIterator litr=al.ListIterator();
while (litr.hashNext())
{
System.out.println(litr.next());
}


here by  using while loop we check is data is present or not by using hashNext() if the data is present then we use next () function in while body and working is same as iterator.

Approach 3 printing / fetching data from ArrayList by Using for loop
Here object of ArrayList consist of data from zero index to last index then by using for loop we can print that data.
When we use for loop then we have to give start index as well as end index condition and increment or decrement operator.
For(int i=0;i<=al.size()-1;i++)
{
System.out.println(al.get(i)); // to print data of index we use objectname.get(index) method
}
Here  compiler will check condition like I is less than end condition then it will enter in loop body and execute printing statement and in that printing statement we give obeject.get(index) method i.e al.get(i) so compiler will print value which is present at 0th index in b’coz initial value of I is 0 then after that compiler compiler will increment I value by one because we use i++ now I value is incremented by 1 then it will again check 2nd parameter which end number condition which is true then it will again enter in loop body and execute printing statement and print value of 1st index this loop is continue until loop get break and we get all ArrayList value printed.
 When we use for loop and cursor ?
When we have less data to print then we use for loop but when we have huge data to print then we use cursor because when we have large data available and we use for loop for print then it will took too much time then we cursor it will print huge data in less time as compared to for loop. Cursor is faster than for loop.
When we cursor then it will print all data. But when we want to print some part of data then we for loop.
Approach 4 printing / fetching data by using for each 
When we use for each then there syntax like
for(Object variablName :objectName have too much data)
{
System.out.println(variableName); // it print data available in Object one by one
}

 here right hand  side of colon we give object name which having too much data but at time we  take one data at time and store it in variable  left hand side of colon and type of this variable is should be object which can read any type of data in collection we have heterogeneous data store in objectname. Varibalename is object type which can store/read any type data. by using variablename we print that data. here we don’t have to need mention start index or end index and increment or decrement.

for(Object s1:al)
{
System.out.println(s1);
}

Here compiler take 1st index data from al and store in it s1 and then enter in loop body and print it again it take 1st index data from al store it in s1 and then enter in loop body execute printing statement and print s1 data which 1st index data. this process continues until all data is printed each time it will take one data at time.

Suppose  we have 7-8 fruits available for eat but at time we can eat one at time we can eat them by one by one

2. Enumeration 
By using enumeration we can print or fetch data of vector class only.
When we want use enumeration cursor for fetching data then we have use then we have use vectorobjectname. We have to call elements() method which is enumeration return type and as it returning enumeration then we have to store it into object or variable like.
Enumeration objectname =vectorobejctname.elements ();
//  Here we are storing data in object which type in enumeration 
Here elements method copy all data of vector in object of enumeration.  In case of enumeration we have method called as elements to copy call data of vector in  enumerations object.
 To fetch data by using enumeration we use while loop
while(enumerationobjectname.hasMoreElements())
{
Syso(enumerationobjectname.nextElement());
}

Here hasMoreElemnts check that data is present in vector or not if present then only its enter in while loop body and print that data is present at  index value. until all data is not printed.



Collection(I)
	1. List(I)
	2. set(I)
	3. queue(I)

1. List(I)
	1. duplicate are allowded in list
	2. allows any no of null values
	3. Storage Type: index
	4. order of insertion-maintain

1. Arraylist(IC)
	1. Default capacity for arraylist is 10
	2. duplicate values are allowded in Arraylist
	3. allows any no of null values
	4. storage type: index
	5. Order of insertion -> maintain


2. Set (sub interface of collection ):
2. Set(I)
Features of Set
	1. Doesn't allow duplicate.
Means in set duplicates values are not allowed means suppose if we add one information i.e. 10 and again we add 10 information for later for at multiple times then it not shown in out put only one 10 value is shown.
2. Allow only 1 null value(except treeset).
In  set only one null values is allowed in hashset and LinkedHashset and  null value is not allowed in treeset. 
3.	Order of insertion-->random/ascending/maintain insertion.
In set order of insertion is vary for all three implementation classes.
4.	Storage type- HashTable
In set  storage type is HashTable means data or information is stored in HashTable format. Data store in table format by using Hash value or Ascii values. in java all characters are have unique ascii value available like for small a =97,b=98,c=99 like suppose if we add abc then all this character having ascii values and when we want to store abc then at that time compiler will store this value in table format at combining or adding ascii value for abc which 294 at this address. Suppose if we add 102 then all character have different ascii then compiler will calculate the ascii value and create address and store 102 at that address.
Hash/ascii value 	Information 
294	abc
147	102
164	s1

Set have three implementation class

1. Hashset(IC)
2. LinkedHashset(IC)
3. TreeSet(IC)

1.Hashset:
Features of HashSet
	1. Doesn't allow duplicate values.
In hashset implementation class duplicates values are not allowed.
2. Allow only 1 null value.
Only one null value is allowed in Hashset. Means we can’t add more than on null value if we add multiple null values but it only show only one null value. 

	3. Order of insertion->Random insertion
In hashset order of insertion  is not maintained means value which we are sent is place at random position.
4. Storage type: hashtable
Data store in  hashset is in  hashTable format by using ascii values
5.	no default capacity.
In hashset there is no default capacity in it. (Default capacity is only available in ArrayList and vector).
	6. DS: Hashtable
Data structure for hashset is HashTable	

7. best choice: To remove duplicate elements when order of insertion is not mandatory.
Suppose we have to much data and we want remove that duplicate data and order of insertion is not mandatory / important then we can use HashSet to store data.

Suppose we have data of many students and we want remove duplicate data but order is not important the we can use HashSet.



Syntax for HashSet is
HashSet objectName=new HashSet();


Methods for HashSet:
1.	add() 
to add data in HashSet.
 Syntax 
ObjectName.add(data which we want to add);
2.	size()
this method is used to find length or size of HashSet class how many information / elements is store in it.
Syntax
syso(ObjectName.size()); // return type of size () is integers so we have use in it syso or in another
Variable
3.	isEmpty()
this method is use to check that data or information is present in HashSet or not. this method return Boolean value.
syntax is
syso(objectname.isEmpty());
4.	contains()
contains method is used to check that one of the object/ information  is present in our Hashset or not then we use contains() method.
sytax
System.out.println(objectName.contains(“Object or information which we want o check”));

In HashSet  in between add or remove or update is not possible because add which we are store in HashSet is place randomly at any position.

5.	remove()
suppose if we want to remove one of information then we use remove method.
syntax is 
Objectname.remove(add information here which you want remove from HashSet);
 Here Right shift or left shift operation is not perform in HashSet because data is not stored in index format data is store in table format it directly remove from that place.


By using printing statement we see or data which is present in hashset is only shown.
  

But if we want to print data of HashSet then we can print All data of HashSet by using the
1.	iterator cursor
2.	for each loop

1.	Printing all data Of HashSet by using Iterator cursor
We can print data of all seven implementation classes which are available in collection.

Iterator ObjectName = HashSetObjectName.ietrator();  // this will copy all data in Iterator’s 
Object
while(ObejctName.hasNext()) // this will check data is present or not 
{
System.out.println(objectname.next()); // this will print all data available one by one
}
2.	Printing all data of HashSet by Using the for each loop
For(Obejct variableName: HashSetObjectName) // this copy all data in HSobject to ob. variable
{
System.out.println(variableName); // print all data present in variable.
}
Suppose we have data in ArrayList which consisting Duplicate data and we cant remove data data then we can use HashSet by Creating Object of HashSet we can copy data of ArrayList in HashSet like
ArrayList ObjetcName=New ArrayList();

HashSet ObjectName = new HashSet(ArrayListObjectName); 
 // here we add ArrayList object  name in Contactor of HashSet it will copy all data which is present in ArrayList into HashSet object and when we Print HashSet data then all duplicate values which is present in ArrayList is remove but Order of insertion is not maintained

2. LinkedHashset:   (Linkedlist  + hashset)
It is combination of LinkedList plus HashSet. It have some features available in LinkedList(order of insertions is maintained) and HashSet(duplicates values are not allowed and only one null value is allowed).
Features of LinkedHashSet
1.	Doesn't allow duplicate values

	2. Allow only 1 null value.
       *3. Order of insertion->maintained.
Means data which we sent in LinkedHashSet is stored in manner by which we sent in it.
	4. no default capacity.
       *5. DS: Hybrid  (linear+ hashtable)
Data structure of LinkedHashSet is Hybrid means it have combination or Linear which is taken from LinkedList which maintained the order and HashTable which taken by HashSet.
	6. storage type: hashtable

	*best choice: To remove duplicate elements when order of insertion is mandatory.
We are overcoming drawback of HashSet by Using LinkedHashSet.

Syntax of LinkedHashSet 
LinkedHashSet ObjectName=new LinkedHashSet();

We can print all data of LinkedHashSet by using 
1.	Iterator Cursor
2.	For each loop


Methods for LinkedHashSet:
1.	add() 
to add data in LinkedHashSet.
 Syntax 
ObjectName.add(data which we want to add);
2.	size()
this method is used to find length or size of LinkedHashSet class how many information / elements is store in it.
Syntax
syso(ObjectName.size()); // return type of size () is integers so we have use in it syso or in another
Variable
3.	isEmpty()
this method is use to check that data or information is present in LinkedHashSet or not. this method return Boolean value.
syntax is
syso(objectname.isEmpty());
4.	contains()
contains method is used to check that one of the object/ information  is present in our LinkedHashset or not then we use contains() method.
sytax
System.out.println(objectName.contains(“Object or information which we want o check”));


5.	remove()
suppose if we want to remove one of information then we use remove method.
syntax is 
Objectname.remove(add information here which you want remove from LinkedHashSet);
 Here Right shift or left shift operation is not perform in LinkedHashSet because data is not stored in index format data is store in table format it directly remove from that place.


By using printing statement we see or data which is present in LinkedHashSet is only shown.
  

But if we want to print data of HashSet then we can print All data of LinkedHashSet by using the
1.	iterator cursor
2.	for each loop

1.	Printing all data Of LinkedHashSet by using Iterator cursor
We can print data of all seven implementation classes which are available in collection.

Iterator ObjectName = LinkedHashSetObjectName.ietrator();  // this will copy all data in Iterator’s 
Object
while(ObejctName.hasNext()) // this will check data is present or not 
{
System.out.println(objectname.next()); // this will print all data available one by one
}
2.	Printing all data of LinkedHashSet by Using the for each loop
For(Obejct variableName: HashSetObjectName) // this copy all data in LHSobject to ob. 
variable
{
System.out.println(variableName); // print all data present in variable.
}
Suppose we have data in ArrayList which consisting Duplicate data and we cant remove data data then we can use HashSet by Creating Object of HashSet we can copy data of ArrayList in HashSet like
ArrayList ObjetcName=New ArrayList();

LinkedHashSet ObjectName = new LinkedHashSet(ArrayListObjectName); 
 // here we add ArrayList object  name in constructor of HashSet it will copy all data which is present in ArrayList into LinkedHashSet object and when we Print LinkedHashSet data then all duplicate values which is present in ArrayList is remove but Order of insertion is  maintained

TreeSet (implementation class of Set sub interface of Collection)
Syntax of TreeSet 
TreeSet objectName= new TreeSet();

 Features of TreeSet:
	Note: we can store only homogeneous data.
 in TreeSet only homogenous data is get store means we can store only one type of that like either String or Integer at a time like Array because order of insertion of TreeSet is Ascending means suppose if we store integer values then it will store that values in serial vice like 1 ,2, 3 like that way and when we store string information or character values then it will store in alphabetical order but if we store integer and string value together then it will get confuse at which place I have to store this that that’s why in TreeSet we can store Homogenous data..
	
1.	Doesn't allow duplicate.
In TreeSet duplicate values are not allowed.
	*2. null values: not allowed
In TreeSet we cant store any null values because when we use null then it will reserve space and in TreeSet it will compare data every time and if we add null value in it then comparison operation is not get perform properly. Because null values and homogenous data three is no comparisons possible that why null values are allowed in TreeSet it will get confused because here order of insertion is Ascending.
	*3. Order of insertion--> Ascending order.
In TreeSet data is Stored in Ascending order means if we store integer data then it will store in ascending order and if we store String/character data then it will store in Alphabetical order.
 

4. no default capacity.
In TreeSet there is no default capacity available. Default capacity is only available in ArrayList and Vectors i.e. 10.
	*5. DS: Balanced tree
In TreeSet data structure is Balanced Tree  this data structure is used to sort data internally in ascending order in case of integer and alphabetically in case of String/character. Balanced tree data Structure is responsible for to sort data.
	6. storage type: HashTable
In TreeSet data storage type is HashTable by using Ascii values data is stored in HashTable format.
		
	best choice: To remove duplicate elements when order of insertion is Ascending order. Suppose we have condition like we have to sort or store data in ascending order or in Alphabetical order then we use TreeSet. Like suppose we have many name or roll number and we want to remove duplicate and want to store in ascending order or alphabetical order this TreeSet implementation class is only works in homogenous data only.

By using System.out.println() we can just see which data is present in TreeSet 

Methods of TreeSet
1.	Add()
This method is used to store data in TreeSet.
Syntax is
ObjectNam.add(add data which we want to store);
2.	Size()
This method is used to calculate the size/ length of TreeSet.
Syntax 
System.out.println(objectname.size()); // this returns the size of TreeSet or how data is 
present in TreeSet object
3.	Contains()
Contains( )method is used for to check that one of the data / information is present in TreeSet or not.
Syntax 
System.out.println(ObjectName.contains(information which we want to check)); // true 
or false
4.	isEmpty()
this method is used to check that TreeSet is empty or data present in it. It will return Boolean value.
syntax
System.out.println(objectname.isEmpty()); // true or false

5.	remove()
if we want to remove any data from TreeSet then we use remove() method.
syntax
objectname.remove(info which we want to remove);

TreeSet have addition methods which are 

6.	first()
Suppose if we want to print/ get first position data present in TreeSet object it will print that data.
Syntax
System.out.println(objectname.first());

7.	last()
if we  want to get data of last position then we have have method called as last().
Syntax
System.out.println(objectname.last()); 

8. pollFirst()
this method is used to remove data from first position then we use pollFirst()
syntax
Objectname.pollfirst();

9. pollLast()
this method is used to remove data from last position of TreeSet.
Syntax
ObjectName.pollLast();
We can print all data of TreeSet by using 
1.	Iterator cursor
2.	for each loop

1.	Printing all data of TreeSet by using  Iterator
Cerate object of iterator then store/ copy data present in TreeSet object into Iterator object like
Iterator ObjectName=TreeSetObjectName.iterator();
while(ObjecName.hasNext())
{
System.out.println(ObjectName.next());
}
2.	Printing all Data by using For each loop
for(Object VariableName:TreeSetObjectName)
{
System.out.println(VariableName);
}
// we use Object as Datatype because we don’t mention here like which data type we are using here that’s why we are using object here because it can read or store any type of data.

Generic 
Means according to our requirement we are customizing the implementation class of collection is called generic. We can convert all 7 implementation classes into generic.
When create object of any Implementation Class the we see <> over there for to specify like String or Integer.
Like
TreeSet <Integer>ObjectName=new TreeSet<Integer>(); // here we customize to store only integer values.

// here in this we can add only integers values
So as here we are declare Integer here so now if we are fetching data by using for each loop then we have to mention Integer here because only integers values are stored init.
Like 
for(Integer VariableName:TreeSetObjectName)
{
System.out.println();
}




	
 What is  difference between collection and collections?
collection : interface
collections: class


read/get
remove
replace
insert new object

Cursors in Collections
1. Iterator
	1. All the collection object (7) --> Universal curser.
We can use iterator to fetch all data from all 7 implementation class. is called universal cursor.
	2. Using iterator and Enumeration we can traverse collection object only in forward direction not in backword --> Single directional cursor
 Means by using Iterator and Enumeration we can travel or print data in forward direction only means 1-2-3-4 we can get data from back ward direction. Means can print data from starting to end we  So its called single directional cursor.
3.	By using iterator we can perform only read and remove operation we can not perform replace and addition of new object.
By using Iterator we can perform read and remove operation but we can add new object or replace operation.
Iterator:
1.	The Iterator interface is a universal cursor that can be used to traverse all implementation classes of the Collection framework.
2.	It allows for fetching data from any collection object. This makes it a universal cursor.
3.	However, Iterator and Enumeration only support forward iteration, meaning you can traverse the collection in a single direction.
4.	With Iterator, you can perform read and remove operations on collection elements, but you cannot perform replace or addition of new objects.

2. ListIterator 
	1. Only applicable for list interface type implementation classes (3)  --> not universal curser.
By using ListIterator we can only fetch data from List implementation classes which are ArrayList, Vector and LinkedList.
	2. Using list iterator we can traverse a List in forward direction and backword direction--> bidirectional cursor
By using list iterator we can print data from start to end and end to start also so is called as bidirectional cursor.
	3. By using listIterator we can perform read, remove, replace and addition of new object operations.
1.	The ListIterator interface is applicable only to List interface implementation classes, such as ArrayList, Vector, and LinkedList.
2.	It enables traversing a List in both forward and backward directions, making it a bidirectional cursor.
3.	ListIterator allows you to perform read, remove, replace, and addition of new objects operations on a List

3. Enumeration 
	1. Only applicable for legacy classes (1) ---->  not universal curser.
By using enumeration we call only fetch data from only vector class which is legacy class in collection. 
	2. Using Enumeration and iterator we can traverse collection object only in forward direction not a backword --> Single directional cursor
	3. By using enumeration we can get only read access.
 By using enumeration we can perform read operation means we can only print data.
1.	Enumeration is applicable only to legacy classes like Vector in the Collection framework.
2.	It provides a way to fetch data only from Vector objects.
3.	Similar to Iterator, Enumeration and Iterator only support forward iteration, allowing traversal in a single direction.
4.	Enumeration provides read-only access to the collection, allowing you to fetch data but not perform other operations like remove, add, or replace.

 We don’t have to perform this read, remove, add , replace operation. 





Single Selected ListBox
(at time we can select only one option)
Suppose we have web page having listbox and we have to select one option at time then we use                 when we open web page and click on drop down /list box then we can see many option but we can select one option at time

When we have to perfrom action on list box then we have to follow three steps which are 

1.indintify the list box and then store it into object by finding Web element
2. and when we want to perform operation on list box then we have to call select name class and we have to its non static method in step 2 we have to create object of select class
3. and in step 3 we can call select class method by using objectname.method name

Like
 1. identify list box which need to be handled and store it in a reference variable.
Like step 1:
WebElement month=driver.findElements(By.xpath(“ //select[@id=’day’]”));
// we store path of list box in object which return type is WebElement
2.Step2 
We have inbuild class which is Select we have to create object of that class
Like 
Select Objectname=new Select(month or webelemnt/ objectname of webement);
Select s=new Select(ObjectNAmeofWebelemnt);
// here we have to pass object of webelement as input into constructor of select class its mandatory. Here we are providing address of list box which we find and store in object we are sending this in select object as into by entering it into contractor as input. And now we can call methods of select method and by using that method we can perform action on list box.
Step 3
We have to call methods of select class there are three methods 
1 selectByVisibleText() 
which can only accept  string text values(we have to mention the text which we are seeing on list box option like Jun, May or etc as it is and that mention option get selected like if we mention May then we will get selected automatically.
Syntax of selectByVisibleText
Objectname.selectByVisibleText(“we have to mention text value present on list box”);
s.selectByVisibleText(“May”); //this will select May option on list box.

We can also get string text box from html code just we have expand that code and the we see all option available then we see>Text< just copy that and mention in () of selectByVisibleText.	
2. selectBYValue() 
this method is also accept only string  value  like for each option we see text is present and along with that value is also present with that like for Jan is 1 and for feb is 2 and we can see that all this values are in “ 1”. Double quotation marks as it integer but we have send it as string 
like 
syntax for selectByValue
ObjectName.selectByValue(“number as string”);
s.selectByValue(“1”); // here Jan option is get selected.

3. selectByIndex()
here this method accept integer input we have to send input in integer input. To find index we have read html code  the value of first index is by default 0 then 1 and last is length-1 we have to calculate that values manually. Suppose if want mention Jan then we have pass value 0.
Syntax for 
ObejctName.selectByIndex( integer value);

s.selectByIndex(0); // Jan option is get selected.

Multiselected List Box 
To perform action on multi-selected list box some time we can select multiple option from list box.
To cerate multiple selected list box we have to add this parameter which multiple =true when we use this then that list box  is converted into multi selected list box.
To perform action on multi selected list box 
First we have to identify then list box 
Step 1:
WebElement selectcountry =driver.findElements(“//select[@id=’1234’]”);
/here we find and identify list box and store in object 
Step2 :
Crete object of select class
Select s=new Select(selectcountry); // here we create object of select class and pass webelemnt objctname as input.
Step3:
To perfrom opetion like if we want select option then 
s.selectByVisibleText(“Ind”); // here we pass string text value available on list
s.selectByVisibleText(“Sirlank”); // here we pass string text value available on list now second optio is also get select because here we can select multi select option are available.
s.selectByIndex(3); //Asu get selected
s.selectByValue(“2”);// Pak is selected // we can also use selectByValue in realtime


Deselected operation for multi selected list box.
We cant use this deselect operation on single selected list box we can only select other option in case of single selected .
 We can only use deselected in case of multiselected list box

First we have select some operation then we can perform deselect operation on that.
Like 
s.selectByIndex(0);
s.selectByIndex(1);
s.selectByIndex(2);
here we select three option but we want perform deselect operation on that
for that we have use 
like for to select we have method like selecteByVisibleText selectByIndex and SelectByValue like same way we have method for deselect also  
1.deselectByVisibleText(“string text value”);
like suppose if we want to remove india then use 
deselectByVisibleText(“Ind”); // now india get deselect 
2.deselectByIndex(integer);
here we can also deselectByIndex() here we have to give index value 
s.deselectByIndex(2); // now second values is get deselected 
3. 	deselectByValue() is also available for deselect.

Suppose if we want to deselectall then have method called as deselectAl()
4. deselectAll();
Syntax 
objectName.deselectAll();


if we want know is list box is single selected or multi selected then by using selenium we can find out that. By using selenium we can find out type of list box is it multiselect or single select 
here we don’t have to select any option here we are just want see list box which is present on webpage is multi selected or single selected .
Here we have method to find out is list box is single selected or multi selected is called  isMultiple()

7. isMultiple()
This method is used to find whether list box is single selected or multiselected if its single selected then it returns false and if its multi selected then return true because is name Multiple. As its return type is Boolean we have to store it an variable.
Syntax is 
Boolean variable/objectname=selectclassObjectName.isMultiple();
Boolean result=s.isMultiple();
Syso(result); // for print result we use printing statement 
We also use if else for showing massage 
if(result==true)
{
Syso(is multi selected);
}
Else
{
Syso(is single selected);
}

Suppose if its single selected list box and there is by default one option is selected. And we want to get select option on list box then we use getSelectOptionFormSingleSelected list box
Here we want to get by default selected option then we use 
8.getFirstSelectedOption()
here getFirstSelectedOption() method returns WebElement this method will return selected Address of option present  on webpage here we don’t get text but we want text or Option name which selected. Select class method not return text directly  this getFirstSelectedOption() will return the address / webElement of selected option. And we know how to get text from webelemnt we have method Called As getText().
As it returning webElemnt we have to store it in variable or object 
Like 
WebElement objectName=SelectClassObjectName.getFirstSelectedOption();
String text=ObjectName.getText(); // as getText () is rertun type is String the we have to store it in another object/ varibel
Syso(text); //here we are priting text/selected option  present on webpage
WebElement selectedOption=s.getFristSelectedOption();
String Text=selectedOption.getText();
Syso(text);

Or
We can also direct call get text like
String text=SelectClassObjectName.getFristSelectedOption().getText();
Syso(text); // it will return text

Text from multi selected text list box
Same function we can use like Suppose we have multiselectable list box and and many options are selected and we want get first option selected then we use same logic to get text of first option selected from many option options.
Get first selected option from multi selected list box then we use 

In multi selected option list no option  is selected by default and so we have to select option then we can find first selected option from multiple selected option.
Like 
s.selectByIndex(1);
s.selectByIndex(2);
s.selectByIndex(3);
now to get text of first selected option then we use  getFristSelectedOption()
like 
String text=s.getFirstSelectedOption().getText();
Syso(text); // here we get first selected option text 

getAllSelectedOptions 
from multi-selected list box
suppose we have multislescted textbox and we have many option selected then and we want get text or print all selected option then we have  method getAllSelectedOptions.
So first we have to select options from list. For that first we have to find address of options on list box
1. First we have to find address of list box first we have to find address of that list box and store it into an another object.
WebEelment country=driver.findElements(By.xpath(//addressoflistbox));
2.Then we  have to create object of of select class object
Select s=new Select();
3.The we have to select some option by using select class method by using object.method name
s.selectByIndex(1);
s.selectByIndex(2);
s.selectByIndex(3);

//And we want to print all this selected option
As before we find text for only one selected option and for that we have only one address is available but here we have multiple address available because we have many option selected.
To find the address of all selected options we have to call method of select class which is 
s.getAllSelectedOptions();
When we call getFristSelectedOption then the return type of this method is WebElement because it contains address of only one selected option.
But 
 When we call this method getAllSelectedOption then the return type of this method is List<WebElement>  List of WebElement because it contains multiple/many  addresses of selected option.
And now we want to print each selected option address and convert it into text for that we use For each Loop.
List<WebElement>  allselectedOptions=s.getAllSelectedOptions();
This object allselectedOptions is contains address of list box so we cant print address directly supposse we want print all address we have use For each loop
Like
for( WebElement s1 : allselectedOptions) 
// here WebElement is object name because allselectedOptions is contains all WebElement Address so as we have only WebElement return type then Object name for now is WebElement.
In Generic when we have only one type data available like String then for each loop we use objectname or dataType string but if we have multiple type data then we use object
 So getAllSelectedOptions have only WebElements available then we use datatype WebElement in for Each loop
for(WebElement s1 :  allselectedOptions) // allselectedOptions contains all address of selected 
option whose return type is WebElement
{
Syso(s1); // when we print this then we will get print  address of selected options
}


But we don't want address we want text / information present on that address 
By using for each loop we are getting one by one information stored in allselectedOptions is fetch / store in s1 and that  we are printing by using printing statement.
As here we want print text so for that we have convert WebElement object i.e. s1 in text for that we use getText() of WebElement like
for(WebElement s1: allselectedOptions)
{
Syso(s1.getText()); 
}
Here we get first address present in allselectedOptions and store in s1 and print by using printing statement and here we address store in s1 and by using getText () we will get text present at that address.
Select class have method which only get address / webelement and we convert it in text by using webelement method getText().

getOptions()
When we want to print all options available in List box then we have method. Here we don’t have to select any option in single or multiselected this method will return all option present in list box.
To print all option we need address of all options and we get that address by using getOptions() method.
And return type of getOptions() method is List<WebElement> because it contains all/many address of options present in list box.
List <WebElement> alloption= s.getOptions(); // here we get addresses of all options present in list 
box
To get address one by one for that we use for each loop and by using for each loop we will print all address and get text present on that by using getText() method.
for(  WebElement s1 :  allOption)  // here allOption have addresses of option present at list box and 						one by one they are storing in s1 object.
{
Syso(s1.getText()); // here we get text present on address
}
Assignment Multiple selected option size print and list box size print.

How to take screenshots By using selenium 
Sometime when test case get fail then we have to take screenshoot of that. 
Suppose we open facebook and we want to take screen shoot of that then we have create code for take screen shoot.

Open website which screenshot we want to take.
Like 
driver.get(“https://facebook.com/”);

To take screen shoot we have to follow steps.
1. Step one
1.Convert webdriver object into TakesScreenshot interface 2. then call the method of getScreenshotAs we have to need to pass input OutputType.FILE execution of this statement it capture the screenshot.
When we want to capture screen shoot then first we have to perform down casting on WebDriver object i.e.(up casting object) driver or we have to convert it into takseScreenShot interface  first we have to call takesScreenShot of driver 
Like
((TakesScreenShot)driver) // here we convert webdriver object driver into TakesScreenShot interface by performing down casting. Is called interface down casting.
2. Step two
2. then call the method of getScreenshotAs we have to need to pass input OutputType.FILE
We have to call TakseScreenShot interface method getScreenshotAs() method  by using this method we can capture screen shot.
When we call this getScreenshotAs() method then it will take screen shot but here we have to mention the output  format of screen shot As we know screen shot is always in File format so here we have to give the format of screen shot like we have to mention in (OutputType.FILE).

((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE); 

// when we execute this we get screen shot in file format in return. And this screen shot is stored in local memory in administrator user temp files. As it return output in file format so we have to store it in file variable or object to know the path or location where the screenshot is storing 
File Src=((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
 // data type is file 
When we print in object i.e. src 
Syso(src); // we will get path where screen shot is stored.

As the screen shot is storing temp folder there are thousand of files are available so its difficult find there 
then we have to cut past this screen shot from this source path to another location(destination). Then we have to cerate folder where we have to paste that screen shot then we have to copy path of that folder and we have to create this path in file format
then we have to create object of File Class

File des=new File(“here we have to paste the path of location where we want to store SC”);
 Here while entering path here we have to give the name of that file or screen shot
Like 
File des= new File(“F:\ScreenShotsel\abc.jpg or png”);
Now we have to move this screen shoot file from source to destination for that we have inbuilt class available in selenium called FileHandler (there are two classes on for selenium and one for java) we have to call FileHandler of selenium and then we have to call static method of fileHandler copy (as it is static method so we have to call it in static  way like differentClassName.methodname) here we have to pass to parameters like object name of source path and destination path which are here src and des and we see error then hover mouse there and add throws which handle exception IOExpection it will handle error.

fileHandler.copy(from,to);
fileHandler.copy(src,des);
 //differentClassName.methodName(source(in file format,despath in file format);


Suppose  if we want to take another screen shot then we have change the name of file or screen shot if we don’t change the name it will override the previous screen shot.

Explanation of how to take screenshot

File Src=((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);

1.	Step number one Convert webdriver object into TakesScreenShot interface then call the method of TakesScreenshot interface which is getScreenshotAs() method here we need to pass the input i.e. (OutputType.FILE) after execution of this statement it capture screenshot 
(OutputTpye is enumeration file is constant which specify output in file format and other output type are Other possible values for OutputType include BASE64, BYTES, and HTML)
fileHandler.copy(from,to);
fileHandler.copy(src,des);
 //differentClassName.methodName(source(in file format,despath in file format);



2.	but screenshot is available in local memory to move this screenshot from local memory to destination folder we need to call static method copy of FileHandler class which accepts two parameters path of source and path destination.


File des=new File(“here we have to paste the path of location where we want to store SC”);
File des= new File(“F:\ScreenShotsel\abc.jpg or png”);


3.	To create the destination of folder path we have to create object of File class which accepts the destination folder path as input.


Or
1.	To take screenshot using selenium webdriver we need to convert or perform down casting / type casting object of webdriver into TakesScreenshot interface.
Ex. ((TakesScreenshot)driver)
2.	then we need to call the function or method i.e. getScreenshotAs() here we need to pass the argument (OutputType.FILE). 
3.	this method will return object of type file 
File Src=((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
4.	when this statement will execute it will take the screenshot  but screenshot is available inside memory.
5.	To store Screenshot in local drive or destination folder , we need to call the statement of method which present in fileHandler class copy method which static nature here we have to pass two parameters path of source and path of destination.


 fileHandler.copy(from,to);
fileHandler.copy(src,des);
 //differentClassName.methodName(source(in file format,despath in file format);


When we take screen shot is will only capture the browser not entire screen.

RandomString Class
When we want to capture many screen shots without changing name then automatically name also becomes different so for that we have to add or concat  some character with name like abcop or abc2e like this 
To do that we have supposed we ween need string then we have inbuilt class available in selenium
Called as RandomString we have to call this class. It consist static method make() method.
RandomString.make(); //diifrentclassname.methodname
// here in () we have to give input like for which length we need random string it will return that length random string as it return string so we have to store  it in object 
Like
String RS=RandomString.make(2);

Here we have to concatenate Object name i.e. RS wit name like 

File des= new File(“F:\ScreenShotsel\abc”+Objectname /RS+”.jpg”);

How to fetch data from excel sheet?
When we write script for automation then all data which we are needed that all data to test is called test data and this test data is stored in excel and we fetch this data from that excel sheet.

We have to follow some steps to fetch data from excel file.
(parametrization
Fetching data from external source and using it in selenium test scripts is known as parametrization 
It can be achieve by using excel sheet , csv file , test NG data provider.

Parametrization is the process of providing different values or parameters to a function or test case to test or execute it with various inputs. It allows you to run the same code logic multiple times with different inputs, improving code reusability and test coverage.)

Step1 .
To fetch data from the excel sheet 1st we have to need to configure Apache POI jar files into our program.

( how to configure Apache POI? 
First we have to search on google download Apache POI then we have open that and  then Form  binary Distribution we have to download 2nd zip file.
Then we have to cut paste all jar file at one plcae and then we have to configure with our project by using configure build path.)

Step2
Create an excel sheet with some data and save it in any drive.

In excel  there are only three types of data is available which are string , numeric(decimal + non-decimal) and Boolean(TRUE / FALSE conditions ).
In excel data is stored in excel format is stored in index format in rows and columns.
Index values of first row is zero and index values for first column is also zero. 
Like we have data like Rahul then row index and column index is (0,0) first row then column.
Like 65.5 index value is(0,1) and TRUE index value is (0,2)

Step3
(from step3 we can start actual fetching data from excel file)
(manually first we go to path where excel file store then we open that  file and then we select the sheet because some time many sheets are available so we have to select the sheet number from which we have to find the row index and column index then we can fetch the data from that.)  
While performing automation we want to navigate to that excel file then we have to create 
Object of FileInputStream 
Like 
FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream(“here we have to mention the path of excel sheet”);
// in constructor of FileInputStream class we have to give the path of excel file in string format.

To open excel file the we have to call inbuilt class workbookFactory  then we have to call the static method of this WorkbookFactory class i.e. create() here we have to pass the object of FileInputStream as input then it will open that excel file. 
Like
Workbook book=WorkbookFactory.create(objectname of FileInputStream);

When we call this cerate() then it return some output of WoorkBook type and workbook is  interface.
 To navigate to sheet present in workbook then we have to call workbookobjectname.getSheet() like 
Workbookobjectname.getSheet();
Book.getSheet(“we have give name of sheet which we want to open”); 
Sheet sh=Book.getSheet(“Shee1”); //this will open sheet

GetSheet() is presnt in workbook interface and return type is Sheet
 Sheet sh=Book.getSheet(“Shee1”); //this will open sheet
Now there are many rows and columns available in sheet so for navigate to desired row and cells(columns) we have to give index. For to navigate to particular row  we have to call the sheetobjectname.getRow() method and return type of getRow methos is Row 
Sh.getRow(we have to pass the index );
Row rw=sh.getRow(0); // here we are naviagte to row 0
And to navigate to particular cell (column ) then in row interface also have method i.e. getCell() method this method is presnt in row interface and return type is cell
To call cell first we have
Cell cl=Rowobjectname.getCell(0); 
//this will return the cell interface output here we navigate to desired data but our data is in string format so print our data like string ( numeric (double), boolean) as want fetch string data then cell interface face method i.e. getStringCellValue()  method  return type of this method is  string and this method is present in Cell interface.
To call this getStringCellValue we have use
String value=CellObjectname.getStringCellValue(); 
String value=cl.getStringCellValue(); //  here we get our desired data.

we have to need just single line code to fetch the data from excel file 
Like 
1st we have to navigate to excel path 
For that we have to use create object of  FileInputStream class and we have pass the path of excel file like
FileInputStream file=newFileInputStream(“path of excel file”);
2nd  To open that excel file we have to call workbookFactory Class’s static method create() whose return type is workbook interface  and in create () we have to give input which is FileInputStramobjectname
Like 
WorkbookFactory.cerate(file) // this will return workbook interface output
3rd then we have to call workbook interface method i.e. getSheet()  this method is presnt in workbook are return type is Sheet we have pass String Sheetname as input in getSheet().
Like
WorkbooFactory.create(file).getSheet(“Sheet1”) // for now its return the output of sheet 										interface

4th  to navigate particular row of that sheet we have to call sheet interface method i.e. getRow() this method is present in sheet Interface and return type is row  in getRow() we have to pass index value of row
Like
WorkBookFactory.create(file).getSheet(“Sheet1”).getRow(0) // this return row interface output

5th  to nviagte to particular cell we have to call the row interface getCell() this method is presnt in row interface and return type is cell  and here in getCell() we have to give input in index value
Like
 WorkBookFactory.create(file).getSheet(“Sheet1”).getRow(0).getCell(0) // this will return type is 							cell interface 
6th we have call cell interface getStringCellValue() whose return type is string and this presnt in in cell interface and this return our desired data
String value=WorkBookFactory.create(file).getSheet(“Sheet1”).getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue();
 
How to fetch data from excel sheet?

Step1 .
To fetch data from the excel sheet 1st we have to need to configure Apache POI jar files into our program.

Step2
Create an excel sheet with some data and save it in any drive.

Step3 
Create object of FileInputStream Class with excel sheet path as an a   input 
Step4 
To open an excel sheet we need to use static method i.e. cerate() which is present in workbookFactory class
Step4.
To open an specific sheet in an excel we need to use getSheet() method.
 Step5
To identify specific row in a sheet we need to use getRow() method
Step6
To identify specific cell in row we need to use getCell() method
 Step7
To fetch string type of information we need to call  getStringCellValue() method 
Or 
To fetch numeric data / information we need to call getNumericCellValue() method
Or 
To fetch the Boolean information we need to use getBooleanCellValue() method.  

When fetch the data from the excel and data is in numeric from then data type or return type of that is Double.
When we fetch data from the excel and data is in Boolean  format then we use  data type or return type is Boolean. 

getLastRowNum()
suppose if want to calculate how many row present is sheet if we want to count length of row then we have method getLastRowNum()  which return the index values as we know row are start from 0 index value starting index value is 0 and onwards.
Suppose if we want to calculate size of row present in sheet then we have method getLastRowNum() this returns index values and by adding 1 or +1 we get size of row.
Suppose we want index then we have to perform size-1.
When want size then we have to perform idex+1
If we want to calculate size of row then we have to use getLastRowNum()+1
Syntax is
int size=WorkbookFactory.create(objectname).getSheet(“Sheetname”).getLastRowNum()+1;
syso(size); // size

getLastCellNum()
suppose if we want to calculate the size of cell / column then we have method i.e.  getLastCellNum()  which return the size directly
syntax if
int csize =WorkbookFactory.create(objectname).getSheet(“Sheetname”).getrow(idex value).getLastCellValue();

suppose if we want to fetch the all data from the particular row
suppose we want to fetch data from row then as row index are  constant but column index is changing.
When we want to print multiple data then we use for loop. And while we use for loop then we have to give condition like start index last index and increment and decrement.
Here we give for loop condition for column because column index are changing and row index is constant.(we give for loop condition for that whose index values are changing.)
Like
FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream(“Path of excel ”);
Sheet sh=WorkbookFactory.create(file).getSheet(“Sheetname”);
int ci=sh.getRow(index).getLastCellNum()-1; // here we get index of column in row
for (int i = 0; i<= ci;i++)
{
Sting value=sh.getRow(index).getCell(i).getStringCellvalue();
Sytem.out.print(value);
}
Here as we want print data in single row so we use print instead of println because we are fetching data from single row. Here row index is fix so we give index value i.e. 0 but column index are changing then we use i for variable of for int getcell(i) index values because changing index values. And as we are fetching data from cell then we have to use getStringCellValue() method which fetch data from cell and all data is in string type of data type or return type is String we stored it in another variable and by using that variable we are printing the values.

Suppose if we want fetch data from multiple row and single column.
Here row index are changing (r1,c2),(r2,c0) like here row index are getting change and column index are constant so here we have to use for loop condition for row because index values of column are constant and index values of row is changing. So we use end number condition for row
Like
int ri=Sh.getLastRowNum();
for(int i=0;i<=ri;i++)
{
String value=sh.getRow(i).getCell(0).getString();
System.out.printn(value);
}
Here we are printing data for same column but different rows so we use println because after printing one data cursor moves to next line. Here row index are changing so we use give i inside getRow(i) because it changing and column index is constant i.e. getCell(0) and as we want fetch data from cell then we have method i.e. getStringCellValue() as our excel sheet containing only String data.
This will fetch all data for multiple row and single column.


Assignment1:
We have to fetch each data from excel sheet where each row have different columns index then as we want to fetch data from multiple row and column then we have to use two for loop 1st for row 2nd for columns
First we have to find index of row how many row are there 
int ri=Sh.getLastRowNum();

and then we have to find that each row have different column size / index then we have to have to find last cell index of each row then

Like
for(int i =0; i<=ri;i++) // for row
int  cellindx=sh.getRow(i).getLastCellNum(); // this condition will check column or cell index for each row .
{
for(int j=0;j<=cellidex-1;j++) // for cell and getCellnum() return size for to convert it in index we use -1 to get index
{
 String str=sh.getRow(i).getCell(j).getStringValue();
System.out.print(str);
} 
Syso();

}

Here we have to find then last index of cell in each row for that we use this logic after outer for loop and before cell it will check cell size for every row.

getCellType()
1.	suppose if we want to know which type of data in present at one of cell like numeric, String or Boolean then we use getCellType(). Suppose we want verify the type of index which type of data is present there then we use getCellType() which is present in Cell interface and return type of this method is CellType is enum present in apache poi 
2.	BLANK: Represents an empty cell that does not contain any value.
3.	BOOLEAN: Represents a cell that contains a boolean value (true or false).
4.	ERROR: Represents a cell that contains an error value.
5.	FORMULA: Represents a cell that contains a formula.
6.	NUMERIC: Represents a cell that contains a numeric value.
7.	STRING: Represents a cell that contains a string value.
. Verify type of cell then we use getCellType.
We have to call getCellType() of cell this method.
If we want to verify type of cell which type of data it have then first we have to navigate to that  
like
CellType ct=Sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getCellType();

Sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).  For this step we reach to that cell and now we want to find type of cell means which type of data is present there  then we have to call method getCellType() this method return the type like numeric, String or Boolean, as it return type is CellType then we have to store it in other object and in that object it will store type of information present at that particular cell like numeric, String or Boolean. CellType return the type which type of data is present like num,String,Boolean.
When we print ct by 
Syso(ct); // return type i.e. numeric ,String or Boolean.

As we get type then like string to print String information we have to call cell interface method getStringCellValue() this method print the string value.
Like
String str=sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue();
Syso(str);

2. Print of information by verify the getCellType 
Suppose we have to print data by verify which data is present at that cell and then we have to print that data. Here we know that data is present in cell but we don’t know type of that data as well as we want print data also so in that case we have to verify the type which type data is present by using getCellType().
Like
Cell c=sh.getRow(0).getCell(0); // here we are navigate to that particular information.
here we are navigate to that particular information. But we don’t verify that which type of data is present at that position. So first we have to verify the type by using getCellType()
like
CellType t=c.getCellType();
 // this method will return the type of index which type of data is present and we are storing it in object so this t object contains type which are numeric, String or Boolean.
So we want fetch the data of that index or cell then we have to compare the type i.e. t namectname of CellType which return the type with Cell.Type which are CellType.STRING,CellType.NUMERIC or CellType.BOOLEAN. for to compare or two check condition we use else if control statement which used to check multiple condition at time.
Like
if(t==CellType.STRING)  // excel string
{
String v=c.getStringCellValue();
syso(v);
}
else if(t==CellType.NUMERIC) //excel numeric 
{
double v=c.getNumericCellValue();
syso(v);
}
else if(t==CellType.BOOLEAN) //excel boolean
{
boolean v=c.getBooleanCellValue();
syso(v);
}

Here if type i.e. t is match with the string then it will print String else if data is numeric it will print numeric value else if data is boolean type then it will print boolean value.

Print of al  information of row or column  by verify the getCellType having different type data.
Suppose if we want to print all data form row or column then we have to verify the data of all indexes we have to check the type of that verify the type then we have to call method to print that data like
Like 
As we are printing all data of row the we have to find the index of cell because row is index is fix /constant  and column index are changing for this case we
int indexofcell=Sh.getRow(0).getLastCellNum()-1; 
for(int i=0;i<=indexofcell;i++)
{
Cell c=sh.getRow().getCell(i) //here data is store in varible
CellType t=c.getCellType();//here we check the c i.e. info type by using getCellType() and store it in variable which return the type i.e numeric,boolean,String now we have to compare this type or variable by using if
if(t==CellType.STRING)
{
String v=c.getStringCellValue();
System.out.print(v+” “); // as here we are printing data for row so we use print
}
else if(t==CellType.Boolean)
{
Boolean v=c.getBooleanCellValue();
System.out.print (v+” “); // as here we are printing data for row so we use print
}
else if(t==CellType.NUMERIC)
{
double v=c.getNumericCellValue();
System.out.print (v+” “); // as here we are printing data for row so we use print 
}


}

Here first we verify which type of data then we store type in variable and then we are comparing if its String then we will get String Value if boolean then we get boolean and if numeric then we get numeric value.

Here we only applying condition 
Print all data of cell
First we have to find index values of row for particular cell here cell index is constant but row index are changing then we use for loop for row because row index are changing
1st we  have to find index of row by using getLastRow()
Like 
int indr=Sh.getLastRow();
2nd we have to use for loop to fetch data from the cell
for(int i=0;i<=indr;i++)
{
Cell c=sh.getRow(i).getCell(0) //here data is store in variable
CellType t=c.getCellType();//here we check the c i.e. info type by using getCellType() and store it in variable which return the type i.e numeric,boolean,String now we have to compare this type or variable by using if
if(t==CellType.STRING)
{
String v=c.getStringCellValue();
System.out.println (v); // as here we are printing data for cell so we use println
}
else if(t==CellType.Boolean)
{
Boolean v=c.getBooleanCellValue();
System.out.println (v); // as here we are printing data for cell so we use println
}
else if(t==CellType.NUMERIC)
{
double v=c.getNumericCellValue();
System.out.println (v); // as here we are printing data for cell so we use println
}


}
Here we get all data in cell

Assignment get all type of data by getCellType()

Here in first outer for loop we give condition for row by using getLastRowNum() method which returns the index value of row how many rows are present in excel sheet then after we give second or inner for loop for columns/ cell and in-between outer and inner for loop we find the index value of each row cell index like each row have different cell size for that we use 
sh.getRow(i).getLastCellNum() this method return the size and by -1 we get index values for cell
then in inner loop body we navigate to each row by using sh.getRow(i).getCell(j) and store it in another variable i.e. cellinfo now we have to find the type of each celltype by using getCellType() which returns the which type of data is present in that cell index and like. cellinfo.getCellType() and as it return the value e store int another variable i.e. s1 and now we check for each cell type by comparing condition by using else if control statement for String, numeric and Boolean if the condition is matching with any one of condition then we get data printed. And As we are printing that data in inner loop then we have to use print and we have to “ space /blank space after printing that that data” and after inner for loop end we have to add empty print statement to move cursor on then line
Like
for(int i=0;i<=indexrow;i++)
{
Cell cellindex=sh.getRow(i).getLastCellNum(); // store it another variable 
for(int j=0;j<cellindex-1;j++) // for column -1 we get cell index
{
				 Cell cellInfo = sh.getRow(i).getCell(j);
			    	CellType s1 = cellInfo.getCellType();
				 if(s1==CellType.STRING)
				 {
					String value = cellInfo.getStringCellValue();
					System.out.print(value+" ");
				 }
				 else if (s1==CellType.NUMERIC) 
				 {
					double value = cellInfo.getNumericCellValue();
					System.out.print(value+" ");
				}
				else if (s1==CellType.BOOLEAN) 
				{
					boolean value = cellInfo.getBooleanCellValue();
					System.out.print(value+" ");
				}
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}
}


getnumeric data as string 
When write script by using automation in that case all the inputs which are need that al inputs we stored in excel sheet and form that excel sheet we fetch that data.
If suppose data present in sheet in String or Numeric like if data is present at left side in excel sheet cell like        and if data present in excel cell is in numeric then that data is present at right hand side like  .
As we get these data from sheet and we stored it into variable and use in our script. 
As we know if we want to pass input then we use sendkeys() and this method only accept the data in string format so as we know if we fetch the numeric data from excel sheet then data data type is double and double data type is not allowed in sendkeys() method. 
So we have to convert  that numeric data into string in excel by using single quattion mark like ‘    When we add ‘ infornt of numeric data then that data is converted into string type and we fetch it by using getStringCellValue() method we can fetch this numeric data which is coverted in string.

Like. 
String value=sh.getRow(0).getRow(1).getStringCellValue();
Syso(value) // get 8544 as string when we fetch double or numeric data that time we see o/p like 8544.0 but we can see we get numeric data as string because .0  is not present.


How to fetch data from excel sheet?
We need to explain all steps like 
1st first we have to create object of FileStream Class and we have to pass into as path of excel sheet in constructor of FileInputStream 
2nd we have to call the WorkbookFactorcy class’s static method i.e. create(which accept path of excel i.e. we strore it in FileInputStream objectnam) then this will open the excel file then we have to call getSheet(“we have to give sheetname which we have to open because in excel sheet there are many sheet available“) it will open that sheet and now we want get that from specific row then we have to call getRow(we have to give here row index) it will navigate to that row and in row there are mnay columns available then we have to call getCell(we have to give cell index) now we are navigate to that particular cell as we want fetch data from that then we have to call getStringCellValue() which fetch the string data and depend on which type of data is present in excel we have to call method like getNumericCellValue or getBooleanCellvalue().

How Get row size ?
By using getLastRownum()+1.
How to get cell size ?
By using getLastCellNum().

How to verify cell type?
By using getCellType().
When we fetch data when data is not present at that index then we get NullPointer exception 

Scanner class
First logical program 
How to get input from user?
Like suppose we want perform addition on two number then that two number are not available and by using program we have to get that numbers form user.
To get or accept data from user on console we make use of Scanner class. We have to create object of scanner class and this scanner class is present in Java.util package. We to pass into in a scanner class constructor which is System.in because to get data form user this System.in Parameter is important like to accept into from keyboard .
Object creation syntax for scanner class
Scanner object name=new Scanner(System.in);


Now we are using input given by user in our program. 
nextInt()
Suppose we want to get/accept  integer input from user then we have to call scanner class method nextInt() method this method accept integer parameters from user and return type of this method is int and present in scanner class. 
When we run this nextInt() method this method accept input on console in integer and as we are getting input from user so we have to store in another variable so we can use that input in our program and we can perform action on that like. int num1=s.nextInt();  when we execute this then compiler will execute right side parameter first i.e. it take/accept  the input from user and store in variable only integer input only.
And as we take input from user and when we use scanner class then in this situation it difficult to understand which is user input and what is out so for understanding we add message to enter input by using printing statement or print statement. 
Actually input is accepted by s.nextInt() method and store in num1 variable.

 like
Scanner object name=new Scanner(System.in);
Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print(“Enter num1”); // this show message only 
int num1=s.nextInt(); 
syso(num1); // for print user data 
system.out.print(“Enter num2”);
int num2=s.next();
System.out.println(num1+num1); // this perform addition 

next()
How to accept string input from user?
By using next() method we can accept string input from user this next() return type is String and present in Scanner class. This next() method accept string input from user.
Syntax is
ScannerClassObjectname.next();
Scanner s= new Scanner(System.in)
System.out.print(“Eneter name”);
String s1=s.next(); // this will accept the string input from user and store in s1 variable.
System.out.println(s1);

Iframe 
Some time some elements are present on main page like user name, password and login button on main page on UI button internally in HTML codes all elemnets are not present on one main page one of element is in frame this is not seen on UI we see all are on page but internally when we see html code then we can observe this 
 
When we want perform action on all 3 elements then we have to find element of user name field then we perform option on that and we try to perform action on password field which is in frame then then by using selenium we don’t perform action on that if try to perform action on that directly then it throws the exception like no such element  exception is found because password is in frame and not present on main page and  by using selenium we only perform action directly on elements which are present on main page and we can’t  perform action on elements which is frame directly. 
So first we have to check that is this element is present in frame. And as element is present in frame then we have to divert selenium’s focus form main page to frame where our element is present on which we have to perform action. 
So when we divert this selenium focus from main page to frame then we can perform action on that  and when again we have to perform action on element which is present on main page i.e. login the again we have to divert the focus of selenium from frame to main page then we can perform action on that. So this way we have to handle the frame.
Some time one of the element is present in frame to perform a action on such element we have to divert the focus of selenium from main page to frame and again we have to divert the focus of selenium from frame to main page to perform action on main page elements. Because by default focus is divert on main page is focus is on frame.
To perform action on iframe practically we are using W3 school web site.
Open w3 then click on Tutorials then click on Javascript  then scroll down the we see option try it your self. then we navigate to new page and on that we see click me to display date and time. So we have to perform this action by automation when click on this it show date and time. And this element in frame. And if we perform action on that directly by finding button address then we perform option on that. Then it shows exception i.e.NoSuchElentException means our xpath is wrong for click me button. Xpath is correct but also we cant perform action on that because this is element is present on main page that element is present in main page have frame present and this element is present in that frame.
How to identify the element is present on frame ?
So for that we have to find address present so from that we have to click on 	arrow of keyboard until we find iframe  tag name we have to check that iframe  is present. When we hover mouse on that iframe  then we see one box is highlighted that box/ block is frame and in that frame element is also present in that. Until we switch to that frame until then we cant perform action on that element.
To perform action on frame first we have to switch or enter in frame then we can perform action on that element.
switchTo:
simple explanation of switchTo():
•	switchTo() is a method provided by the WebDriver interface in Selenium.
•	It enables you to switch the focus from the current frame or window to another frame or window within the browser.
•	The method takes different parameters, such as frame name or ID, index value, or the window handle, depending on the target you want to switch to.
•	Once the focus is switched, you can perform actions like finding elements, interacting with form fields, or extracting data from that specific frame or window.

switchTo().frame()
To stich from main page to frame we have statement 
 Syntax is
Webdriverobjectname.switchTo.farme()
driver.switchTo().frame();

here in frame we can switch by using four way’s 
1.	switch to frame by using String frameID
frame id is present in iframe address we have to copy that id and we have to enter that id in
driver.switchTo().frame(“frameID as string ”); this statement switch selenium in frame and then perform action on element  which is present in frame.
2.	Switch to frame by Using String framename
 This framename  is present in ifreame address we have to copy that and we have to enter that in 
driver.switchTo().frame(“framename as string  ”);
this statement witch selenium in frame and then we can perform action on element which is present in frame.
3.	Switch to frame by using WebElement
We can also switch to frame by using xpath like
driver.swithcTo().frame(“we have to add address of iframe here”); 
like 
driver.switchTo().frame(driver.findElement(By.xpath(‘’iframe address by //tagname[@attribute =’value’]”)      … this statement identity the frame and switch selenium on that then perform action on element present inside farme.
4.switch to frame by using index 
By using index also we can switch to frame but by using index its difficult to switch in frame by knowing the index of frame because there are many frames available. we can switch into frame by using frame index also. Index of iframe is changing continuously and its difficult to switch by using index in real-time.
Syntax 
driver.switchTo.frame(by passing integer index value);

How To handle iframe ?
1. To handle iframe first we need to switch the focus of selenium from main page to frame by using statement i.e. driver.switchTo().frame() we can switch  to frame by using four different ways 
1.	By using string frameID
2.	By using  String framename
3.	By using WebElement
4.	By using frame index 
By using any one of them we can switch in frame.
2. Once actions are perform on component’s present in iframe selenium will not navigate by default to main page 
3. to navigate from iframe to main page we need to use methods 
1.parentFrame()
2. defaultContent()

How to switch from iframe to main page?
To switch from iframe to main page
As we want to perform action on main page we need to navigate the selenium from iframe to main page then we have to use two methods.
1.parentFrame()
2. defaultContent()
By using any one method we can switch the focus of selenium from iframe to main page. And now we can perform action on elements which are present on main page.

Difference between parentFrame() and defaultContent() 

 
Suppose we have main page it having some multiple ele1 main page have child 1 i.e. frame1 and in that ele2 is present and farme1 also have one child i.e. Frame2 and in that also one element is present i.e. ele3. Here parent is main page its immediate child is frame1 and any child is frame2 main page also another child i.e. frame3 and its having one element within it i.e. ele4  and ele5 is present on main page.
So here we want perform action on all five elements then first we have to perform action on ele1 then we have to switch it on frame1 by using driver.switchTo().frame() then by passing id or name we can enter in frame1 and then we can perform action on ele2 and again we have to switch in frame to so again we have to call driver.switchTo().frame() and we have to pass id or name or xpath then we can enter in frame2 and we can perform action on ele3 and directly because it is child of frame1 but if we want to perform action on elem4 of frame3 then we cant  switch directly from frame2 to frame3 first we have to switch to main page by using defaultContent() this method is used to jump or navigate to any child to root of parent or main page directly. And but when we use parentFrame() then this it navigate to frame1 then which immediate parent of farme2 and we want to perform action on main page then again we have to use parentFrame(). This parentFrame method is only navigate selenium focus to child to immediate parent only. So here we have to use this method two time as we want to navigate from frame2 to main page.

defaultContent() : 
if we use driver.switchTo().defaultContent() then it will navigate to any child to main page.
defaultContent() this method is used to jump or navigate to any child to root of parent or main page directly.
Syntax is 
Driver.switchTo().defaultContenr();c
parentFrame():
if we use driver.switchTo().parentFrame() then this will navigate from child frame to immediate parent frame.

This parentFrame() method is only navigate selenium focus to child to immediate parent only.
Syntax 
driver.switchTo().parentFrame();

why we use frame in code ?
if we use same element in 5-6 pages then we have to mention same code of that so instead of that code on main page this element code is stored in frame and that frame address is placed at that element address. Its avoid duplicate codes.

So how to verify element is iframe or main page?
So we have to right click on that then we see extra option like view frame source and reload frame option there. If this present means element is present in iframe. If this extra option is not available then element is present on main page.
 

Pop Up handling
When we perform action on web page element then small windows is get open that windows is called pop up.
Pop ups are small or separate windows which will be displayed when we performed action on any component’s these popups can be Handel by selenium directly, but some time we may need to use 3rd party tools to handle.
Types of pop ups:
1.	Hidden-division Pop up
2.	Alert pop
3.	Child browser Popup
4.	Authentication pop up
5.	File Upload Pop Up
6.	File download Pop up.
All pop types have there unique features. So identifying that features we can identify feature which type of feature is this.
Some time when pop up elements identified by selenium so sometimes selenium directly handle that pop up but some time we have to use some third party tools.
When we perform action on web page element like buttons or link then one separate box or window is open that are called as pop ups.

1.	Hidden- Division pop up
Features of hidden division pop ups are
When pop up are colour full and we can inspect element present in pop up then we called as Hidden division pop up.
1.	This pop ups are colour full
2.	We can inspect the elements present in pop up.
3.	No need to switch we can perform action directly on Hidden Division Pop up
URL: https://www.flipkart.com/


Like pop up present on flipkart are colour full and when try it inspect then we can inspect also.
How to handle/ perform action on  hidden division pop up?
To perform action on Hidden Division Pop up we can perform action on Hidden Division pop up directly we need not to switch to focus of selenium by using 
1st we have to hit URL 
driver.get(“https:www.flirpkart.com/”);
2nd we can directly inspect elements present on pop up then finding there xpath or address we can perform action on that
//Enter user name
driver.findElement(By.xpath(“xpath expression ”)).sendkeys(“abs”); // input enter in elements
//enter password 
driver.findElement(By.xpath(“Xpath expression”).sendkeys(“basds”);
// click login button
Driver.FindElement(By.xpat(“Xpath expression”)).click();
We can perform operations on hidden division pop up directly as we perform action on main page by finding address of elements.
2.	Alert pop up / confirmation pop up
When we click on web page element then on small window is get open and when we right click on that then inspect option is not available here means we can get address of elements which are present on that pop up. As we are not able to inspect the that pop up means we are not able to preform action on that.
So selenium’s emblements methods are not here so 
How to Identify Alert/ confirmation pop up?
A pop up on which we are unable to inspect the elements present on pop up and pop having Ok or cancel button on it or some time both buttons are available along with this some text is present on that having ? mark sing or ! exclamatory sing is present.
Features of Alert or Confirmation pop up
This alert pop up is used for confirmation purpose like save, delete, update etc.
1.We cannot inspect the elements present in pop up.
2. these pop ups will contains ok button or cancel button and Text.
3. sometime these types of popups also contains ? or ! symbol.
4.. URL: https://demo.guru99.com//test/delete_customer.php

How to handle alert pop up /confirmation pop up.?
1.	To handle alert pop up 1st  we need to switch selenium focus from main page to alert pop up by using then we can perform action  on that by suing statement 
To witch in alert pop up we have syntax i.e.
Alert alt=WebDriverobjectname.switchTo().alert(); // this statement return the Alert interface output  this statement switch the focus of selenium from main page  page to alert pop up.
Alert alt=driver.switchTo().alert(); // we can store to variable/object i.e. alt and this is Alert type. By using this we only switch one time and we can use it multiple to perform action on alert pop up.
2. Alert is an interface which contains abstract methods like:
		1. accept(): use to click on ok button.
		2. dismiss(): use to click on cancel button.
		3. getText(): use to get text present in a alert popup & return type is String.

	--> To click on OK button
		alt.accept();

	--> To click on Cancel button
		alt.dismiss();

	--> To get the text present in a webpage:
		String text = alt.getText();
Actions which we can perform on alert / confirmation pop up
1.	alert(()
this method is used to get return type of alert() is Alert interface. Alert interface have some method by using that we can perform action on alert pop up. 
2.	getText()
We can get the text present on that pop up by using getText() method of Alert interface. Return type of this method is String and present in Alert interface.

Syntax is 
String str=driver.switchTo().alert().getTex(); // this method returns the text present on 
Or
alt.getText();
Syso(str);	// output string						Alert pop up.
3.	dismiss()
by using this method we can click on cancel button present on alert pop up. Return type of dismiss() is void and present in Alert interface.
Syntax is
driver.switchTo().alert().dismiss(); // this will click on cancel button present on alert pop up.
or
alt.dismiss();
4.	accept(()
this method is used to click on ok button present alert pop up.
Syntax 
driver.switchTo().alert().accept(); // this accept method perform action on ok button means click on ok button.
 Or
Alt.accept();
When we click on OK then then another alert pop up is open so we can click on that alert pop up also.
Then again we have to call this accept()
i.e.
driver.switchTo().alert().accept();
alt.accept();
 
5.	sendkeys() 
sometime we have to pass inputs elements present on Alter pop up then by using sendkeys() we can pass the input in element. 
Can we pass input to alert pop up ?
Yes. By sendkeys() of alert interface this method we can pass input to alert pop up elements

Implicit wait 
This implicit wait is selenium’s  wait. Like java have wait by like.Thread.sleep()  like this selenium have implicit wait.
Syntax 
WebDriverobjectname.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(time in second));
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10) );
in thread we have to give wait in milli second but in implicitlyWait() we have to pass wait in seconds.


We give wait because when we use get() method to open URL then  when page is not get completely load then this get() method don’t allow to perform any action on web page elements until it get load 100 %. Because if we perform any action on web element before it load 100 percent then there is chances that our script may get failed.  This get method is only mange this for only for home page. 
When we click on other elements and to get load that some time is required but if we directly perform action on elements then here is also chances that script may get failed to avoid this we use implicitlyWait() method.
When we are navigating from page 1 to page 2 then he have 10 second time get load. If page is loaded within 2 sec then it can perform action directly when page get loaded. But if page is not get loaded in 10 second then it will fail that scripts. Now we give 10 second wait but it not compulsory that every time it will wait for 10 second it perform action immediately when page is get loaded within 10 seconds then that may be 2sec-5sec doesn’t matter but if page is note get load within 10 second then it will fail that script. We have to add only time this explicitlywait() then it will wait 10 seconds to get page load.
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10)); 
this one statement is valid for to wait 10 second to get page load completely.
But when we use java wait i.e. Thread.sleep(20000)i.e. then very time it will wait for 20 second after preforming action. And we have to mention this very time after  navigating from page one to page two.

So from now when we perform any action like we have to navigate from one page to another then we have to use this method.





3. Child browser Popup/window popup
Suppose we have one main page when we click on one of the element present on main page then new tab will get open and  we have to perform action on new tab elements in this case main page is only one but when we perform action on main page then new pop up or window will get open then it is called as child browser pop up or window pop up. which look like main page.
As when we click on element on main page then new page is get loaded and it need some time get load so we have to wait for some time when page is to get load completely. For that we use implicitly wait.
Syntax 
WebDriverobject.manage().timedouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSecond(time in sec i.e. 11));
If we perform action on that child browser directly then it not possible it throws the expectation no such element is found. Because by default selenium focus is on only main page. Here new tab is get open but selenium focus is on only on main page it not change directly to child browser.
to perform action on child browser pop up element then we have to switch the selenium focus from main page to child browser pop up and then we can perform action on child window. for that we have to  syntax i.e.
webdriverobjectame.switchTo().window(“ string child browser id”)
here we have to pass input in window method i.e. String child browser id.
But we don’t have that id from where new window is get open id. Means not URL every main page and child window have it unique ID so we have to get that ID so by getting that ID we can switch on that child browser.
So to get child window ID in that case we have to use syntax 
Like
Webdriverobjectname.getWindowHandles();
This getWindowHandles() method return ID of Both main page as well as window pop up also. Return type of this method is set<String> and present in webdriver interface. As it returning multiple string value then type of this method is set of string because in set duplicate values are not allowed because this all ID’s are Unique. Because id is present in the from of string.
And suppose we want to get ID of main page only then we have that is
driver.getWindowHandle();
return type of this method is string it return value of main page only. which is present in webdriver interface.
When we call 
Set<String> allIDs=driver.getWindowHandle();
So here both main page ID as well as child pop up also but we only want child pop id in set contain multiple information but we cant get particular information form set because in set information is stored in Hash table format and indexes are not present here but indexes are present in List so we have to covert/copy  this set <String> information to ArrayList <String> then we in ArryList by default first information is stored at 0th index i.e. main page ID  and 2nd information in our child information ID at 1st index.
So we can to copy any collection object  data to any other object of collection  
Like
ArrayList<String> id= new ArrayList<String>(“name of setobjectname i.e. allIDs”); //this copy set object data in arraylist object i.e. id
And now we can get present at specific index data from   because in arraylist data store in index format.
String childID=Id.get(1); this returns then ID value for 
So now we get id get so now we can enter in into window() as an input.
Like
driver.switchTo().window(childID);
so now focus is switch from main page to child browser. Now by finding element we can perform actions of element present on child pop up.
after again we want perform action on main page then again we have to switch focus of selenium from window pop to main page then again we have to execute statement like
driver.switchTo().window(“we have to pass String main page ID ”);
now by executing this statement selenium focus is switch from window pop to main page. And now we can perform the action on main page element.
When two child pop up window is open then now we can get main page id as well as two child pop id which open first it index values is one and which open next then it have index value 2. Main page id is always zero.
   Features of  Child Browser pop up:
1.	we can inspect element present in popup. 
2.	This pop up will contain address field i.e. address field, maximize ,minimize and close. 
 1.we can inspect elememt present in popup.
        2.This popup will contain address field(url),maximize,minimize and close options.
	3.URL: https://skpatro.github.io/demo/links/

	-----Procedure to handle Child browser popup-------

	1. To handle Child browser popup we need to switch selenium focus from main page to Child browser popup by using syntax
		driver.switchTo().window("String ChildwindowId")

	2. To get address of main page as well child browser we need to use synatx
		set<String> IdOfMainPage=driver.getWindowHandles();
		return type of getWindowHandles method is set<String>

	3. To get address of only main page we need to use syntax		
		String IdOfMainPage=driver.getWindowHandle();
		return type of getWindowHandle method is String

			
	4. To get address of child browser we need to use synatx
		Set<String> ids = driver.getWindowHandles();		
		ArrayList al=new ArrayList(ids);
		System.out.println(al.get(0));  // address of main page
		System.out.println(al.get(1));	// address of child browse

 
Actions Class
By using Actions Class methods  we can perform mouse related operations. Like mouse right click mouse left click, mouse drag and drop.
(The Actions class in Selenium WebDriver is a specialized class that allows you to perform advanced user interactions, such as mouse movements, keyboard actions, and complex gestures, on web elements. It provides a way to simulate real user interactions with a web page.)
By using action class we can handle drop down also
Drop down means  when hover mouse pointer on one of element/option then we see multiple hidden options is called drop down when we move mouse pointer from that again that option are get hide is called drop down elements.
List box means  when we left click on list box then we see options and we can select one of them But in case op drop down when we just hover mouse pointer on drop down then we can see hidden options and we can select one of them  and when we move mouse pointer to other positions then that options are again get hide.
Handling of drop down 
 So to perform action on drop down first we have to move mouse pointer on that drop down element by finding address of that drop down.
First we have to navigate to flipkart site and when we open flipkart site by automation then login window get pop up then we have close it by finding element of close X mark. Then we have to find the address of drop down element 
Handling of drop down 
There are some steps we have to follow like
Step 1: Identify drop down element.
WebElement moreEl=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“//div[text()='More']”); 
// here we find address of drop down and store in object i.e. morel and its type is WebElement
Step 2: Create an object of Actions Class with WebDriver Object as a input.
To perform mouse related action we have to use of Actions Class we have to create object of Action Class and we have to use of its  non-static methods. And we have to pass WebDriver object name as input in constructor of Actions Class.
In a case of list box we have to pass webelement object name as a input 
But 
 In case of drop down we have to create object of action class and we have to pass webdriver Object name as input.
Like
Syntax 
Actions act = new Actions(webdriverObjectName);
 Actions act = new Actions(driver); 
// here we create object of action class and we pass webdriver object as an input i.e. driver.
Now by using object of Actions class and methods of Actions class  we can perform mouse related operations.

Step3: to open drown elements we have method available in actions class i.e. moveToElement(); this move to element is present in Actions Class and Return type of this method is Actions class. This method move mouse pointer on target  webelement which sent as an input. Which we identify and stored in object as an input to moveToElement(). Like
act.moveToElement(moreEl).perform();
This method move mouse pointer on that target web element. And to perform this method or to execute methods of Actions class every time we have to call perform() every time. 
When we execute this then mouse pointer is move on target web element and now drop down element are get visible and then we can perform action on that options.
(To perform action on option present on drop down we have to find address on them for that first we have to hover the mouse on that drop down then option are get seen then we have to directly inspect that option elements. And we when we get address then we can perform action on that elements )
driver.findElement(By.xpath(“//div[text()=’Advertise”]”)).click();

Actions class methods:
1.	moveToElement():
This method move mouse pointer on that target web element. By default mouse pointer is present on left top corner of browser so this moveToElement() is used to move mouse pointer on target element.
2.	perfrom():
we have to use this method always when we have to perform any mouse related operations/actions or with actions class method.
3.	contextClick()
this method is used to perform right click operation where the mouse pointer available.
4.	build()
when we perform multiple operations combined then we use build (). To combine multiple action in single statement  we have build method
5.	contextClick(WebElement target):
(contextClick of webelement 
here we have to pass webElement object it will move mouse pointer to target element and execute right click operation on that element .  this method is used to perform right click on target element. in this method moveToElement is also present in this method 
6.	click()
click() this method perfrom left click operations where mouse pointer is present.
7.	click(WebElement target)
i.e. click of WebElement this method first hover the mouse pointer on target webelement and then perform left click operation on that.
8. doubleClick()
This method used to perform double click operation on where mouse pointer is present.
9. doubleClick(WebElement target)
doubleClick(WebElement target) i.e. doubleClick of WebElement here we have to pass target web element then is move mouse pointer on that target element. It contains moveToElement internally.
11.	dragAndDrop(source,target)
To perform drag and drop operation we have to used of actions class method i.e. dragAndDrop(source,target).
12.	clickAndHold()
call clickAndHold() it clikcAndHold() that element.


Mouse Right Click Operation 
 To perfrom right click operation on element 
1st we have to find address of that element then we have to store it in one variable 
Like
WebElement elem=driver.findElement(“expression of element”);
So whenever we want to perform related functions then we have to use of Actions Class method so first we have to create object of Action Class then in that constructor we have to pass webdriver object as an input.
Like
Approach 1
Actions act = new Actions (driver);
act.moveToElement(elem).perform(); // this statement move mouse pointer to target element and perform() is used to perfrom this method.
act.contextClick().perform(); // when we run this code then it perform right click on top left corner of browser.(but we don’t want to right click here we have on perfrom right click operation on target element for that we have to use of moveToElement()
so by using this code we can perfrom right click on target element.
Approach 2
Like 
act.moveToElement(targetelementwbelobjectname).contextClick().build().perform(); // this perform right click operation on target element
1st we have to move mouse pointer on that target element 
2nd then to perform right click we have to call contextClick() 
3rd as we are performing multiples actions together then we have to call build() and 
to execute each statement we have to call perform().
Approach 3
 ActionClassObjectName.contextClick(WebElement Target); 
act.contextClick(targetelement i.e.webelementObjectName).perform();
here we have to 2 method available
 1st is contextClick() : when we call this method it perform right click where the mouse pointer is available.
and 2nd is contextClick(WebElement target): (contextClick of webelement ) here we have to pass webElement object it will move/hover mouse pointer to target element and execute right click operation on that element .
in this method moveToElement is also present in this method.
Mouse Left Click 
When can perform mouse left click on element 
To perform  mouse left click 1st we have to move mouse pointer on that element and then we have to perform left click on that element.(web Can perfrom webElement click () also and mouse left click () also)
1st First we have to identify the webElement then We have to store it in object like
WebElement tarEl=driver.findElement(By.xpatha(“expression ”));
2nd As we want to perform mouse related operation then we have to use of Actions class method for that we have to cerate object of Actions Class. And we have to pass webdriver obeject as an input.
Like
Actions act= new Actions(WebDriveObject);
 3rd Then we have to move mouse pointer on that element by using moveToElement() method
Like 
Approach 1
act.moveToElement(tarEl).perform()
then we have to call click() this method perfrom left click operations where mouse pointer is present 
act.click().perform();
this statement are used to perform left click operation on target element.
Approach 2
act.moveToElement(tarEl).click().build().perform();
by using this approach we can also perform right click operations.
Approach 3
We have method available i.e. click (WebElement target) i.e. click of WebElement this method first hover the mouse pointer on target webelement and then perform left click operation on that.
act.click(tarEl).perform();

Mouse Double click operation 
When want to perfrom double click functionality on one of WebElement then we have method doubleClick().
1st we have to identify of element and store it in object like
WebElement tarEl=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“expression”));
2nd As we want to perfrom mouse related operation then we have to use of Actions Class methods for that we have to create object of Actions Class. And we have to pass webdriver object as an input in constructor. 
Like
Actions act = new Actions(WebDriverObject);
Approach 1
act.moveToElement(tarEl).perform(); // this method move mouse pointer on target element 
act.doubleClick().perform(); // this method execute double click operation on element where the mouse pointer is available.
Approach 2
act.moveToElemenet(tarEl).doubleClick().build().perform();
build() is used to combined multiple actions and to execute each actions we call perform ().
Approach 3
Here we have doubleClick(WebElement target) i.e. doubleClick of WebElement here we have to pass target web element then is move mouse pointer on that target element.
Like 
act.doubleClick(tarEl).perform();

Drag and Drop 
Some time we have to perform drag and drop operations.
In this drag and drop we have to two element i.e. 1st source element and 2nd is destination element.
In here we have to darg element from source and we have to drop at destinations.
1st To perform darg and drop we have to identify both source and destination and we have to store it in objects.
Like
 WebElement src=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“expression”));
WebElement des=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“expression”));
2nd  As we are performing drag and drop operation of mouse then we have use of action class method for to used that we have to create object of Actions class and we have to pass webdriver object as an input in constructor.
Like 
Actions act = new Actions (driver);
//To perform drag and drop operation we have to used of actions class method i.e. dragAndDrop(source,target).
ActionsClassObjectName.dragAndDrop(source,target); 
Like
Act.dragAndDrop(src,des).perform();
// when we execute this statement then it perfrom drag and drop operations.
Here internally works like by default mouse pointer is present at top left corner then it move to source element then it perfrom click and hold and then move that pointer to destination elements and then we release it. It performing internally combine all this operation. 
When can perform it sperate also.
Approach 2
Like 
act.moveToElement(src).clickAndHold().moveToElement(des).click().build().perform(); // this alter net method not used 
this moveToElement move mouse pointer to source element then we have to call clickAndHold() it clikcAndHold() that element and as we want move to destination element by using moveToElement() hover the mouse pointer on destination element. then we  have to called build () as we are combined multiple actions and then we have to call perform() to execute each statement.
-Handling of DropDown
Step1: Idendify dropdown element
step2: Create an object of Actions class with webdriver object as a input
step3: Call Actions class methods--> moveToElement  to display options present in dropdown

-Action class methods

1. moveToElement
2. contextClick  --> To perform mouse right click action
3. perform -- To execute each statement/action
4. build  -To combile multiple actions in a single statement
5. click  --> To perform mouse left click action
6. doubleclick --> To perform mouse  doubleClick action
7. dragAndDrop --> To perform mouse  dragAndDrop action
8. clickAndHold
9.
Customized List Box
List box having tag name other that select like div, span, input then that list box is called as customized list box.
A list box created using without select tag name is called customized list box.
If list box have tag name select then we can perform action on that list box by using select class method but if is list box tag name is other than select then by using select class method we cant perform action on that list box they are not works in case of customize list box.
Till now we perform action on list box by using select class method because that list box have tag name select.
A list box whose tag name is other than select then in that case select class method is not work properly.
So to handle customized list box then we have to use mouse hover mouse cursor on that list box element then left click, then we have to use of keyboard input like arrow up, arrow down to navigate the options present on list and we use  keyboard input enter key to select that option.
We can use keyboard operations  by using Actions  class and keys enum.
Keyboard keys are stored in enum have name of keys(enum is like class, interface so enum is concept present in java in which we can create constants so in  this keys enum all keyboard inputs/buttons are stored as constant.
So by using Actions class and keys enum we can perform actions related to keyboard.
How to handle customized list box?
1st To Handel customized list box first we have to get address on list box and stored it in object.
WebElement list=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“expression”));
So as it’s customized list box so we cant make use of select class methods. So we have to make use mouse inputs and keyboard inputs to perform operation on customized list box.
(we can wait until page is get load by using implicitlyWait)
So to perform mouse related operation  we have to create Actions Class object. And we have to pass webdriver object as input to it. Then by using Actions class method we can perform mouse related operations. So here to open that list box we have to right click on that list box element by using Actions class method i.e. click  of webelement like. actionsclassobjectname.click(target element).perform() so this method left click and open that list box 
Like
Actions act = new Actions (driver);
act.click(list).perform();
so in that list box current month option is selected by default.  So to perform arrow up operation of keyboard we make use key bord arrow up key
to make use of arrow up key we have to use of actionsclass object name and actions class method sendkeys() to perform keyboard related operations. We can provide it keyboard input. Like Keys.ARROW_UP i.e. keys is enum present in java in which we can create constants in this keyboard related constants are created in this.(All Keys are present in this keys enum).
Like 
act.sendkeys(Keys.ARROW_UP).perform();
this perform arrow up operation once.(if we want to arrow up 2 time then we need to call this statmet 2 times)
 to perform down ward operation like we can make use arrow down of key board also navigate one option down using arrow down key
like
act.sendKey(Keys.ARROW.DOWN).perform();
this method perform arrow down operation once.
So to select option which is currently/highlighted selected  we need to make use of ENTER key of keyboard.
Like 
act.sendKeys(Keys.ENETER).perform();
this method select the option which is currently selected.
By using for loop
By using for loop we can perform any statement many time like. suppose we want to perform arrow up operation 4 time then we use arrow up 4 time like
for(int i=0;i<=4;i++)
{
act.sendKey(Keys.ARROW_UP).perform();
}
This perform arrow up 4 time.


Home key
(suppose we have requirement like we have to select Aug option but by default this list box is options are selected depending or current month like dec. but suppose if we run this program in January then it will perform arrow up 4 time and then select but there is no option available upper Jan so it will select Jan  but we want to select Aug then it not correct option, suppose we have current month July the then it will perform arrow up 4 time and we get option selected. Here selected options are dynamic means every month selected option are changing but present options are same so In this case  )
Key board have home key available like suppose now dec month is selected but when we select home key from key board then it directly jump to first options then now we can navigate to our desired option i.e. Aug
 Navigate to first option using home key 
Like
act.sendKeys(Keys.HOME).perform();
this statant will select/highlight first option directly.
And to navigate to Aug we have to perform 7 time down arrow by using loop. It will select Aug every time. 
End key
This button directly navigate to last option directly. This key will directly jump to last option. 
Now we want to select Aug then we need to perform arrow up 4 time by using for loop it will select Aug option



 How to handle customized list box?
The list box which is created without using select tagname is called customized list box.
Steps to handle customized list box
1.	Identify the list box which need to be handel and store it in object of WebElement.
Like
WebElement ele= driver.findElemenet(By.xpath(“expression”));
2.	Crate an object of Actions class which accept webdriver object as an input.
Actions act = new Actions(driver);
3.	To click on the identified element we have to call actions class method i.e. click of WebElement.
act.click(ele).perform();
4.	We have to select option we need to perform arrow up , arrow down and select that particular option.
A.	To move one option up ward by using arrow up key
Syntax :
act.sendKeys(Keys.ARROW_UP).perform();
B.	To move one option downward we have method
Syntax
act.sendKeys(Keys.ARROW_DOWN).perform();
C.	To select option we have 
Syntax
act.sendKeys(Keys.ENTER).perform();
5.	Note:
a.	To move arrow at top 
Count how many options are present in list box for ex. Month filed 12 options are there: then we have to use of for loop to perform arrow up or arrow down.





findelements(By) method
difference between findElement and findElements is that in findElement() method we only pass single expression by using findElement() we can perform action on single element present on web page but by using  findElements we have to pass multiple matching expressions and we can perform operations on multiple elements.
By using findElement () we can identify single element and by using findElements() we can identify multiple elements.
Suppose we have situation like we have to print text  all links present on Facebook web site like on Facebook page many links are available there so want to print that.
So here we have to make use of findElements because we want get text present on all links from facebook so we. So we have to make use of findElements () because we want to identify multiple address.

When we use findElement() then we have to pass single matching element xpath it perform operation on that and return type of findElement is WebElement because it contains only one address.
To identify multiple elements we use findElements() we have to multiple matching xpath and return type of findElements() is List<WebElement> because it contains multiple addresses.
When we call this findElements() then we have to pass multiple matching ling xpath
Like
List<WebElement> alllinks=driver.fidnElemets(By.xpath(//a));
//here we call method findElements() and when pass xpath then it will find all multiple matching elements addresses and store in alllinks. i.e. object of List<WebElement>. (Now we have to pass multiple matching xpath for that we have to pass so here we want print text from all links present on facebook then tag name of link is a. and a tag name is only valid for links. So we can jump form parent of a directly by using //a // show the relative xpath means we can jump from parent to any child i.e. //a (so it will show all links present on facebook) //a it is an relative xpath so we will pass it as an input.so here it will identify address of all element and store it in object whose return type is List<WebElement>.
So here all address are stored in List object now can get address one by one and convert it into text for that we can make use of for each loop
for(WebElement o:alllinks)
{
Syso(o.getText);
}
Now we can get text present on all links one by one like 1st link address is stored in o variable then it will print text present on that then again it store 2nd address this process is continue until loop get brake and we get all link text printed.
? marks means language is not supported to laptops.
“    “ link is present but text is not present on that link
When we want to perform action on single element then we make use of findElement () we have to pass single matching xpath address and we want to perform actions on multiple element then we to pass multiple matching xpath it returns multiple address and it return type is List<WebElement>.
Suppose we want to print size means total number of links present then we use size() of list as alllinks address are stored in List <WebElement> like
objectnameOfList<WebElement>.size()
int size=alllink.size();
syso(size); // it will show how many links are present on facebook site.
Or
int size=driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//a”)).size();//List<WebElement> .size () return size. This size() is method of list.
syso(size); // it will show how many links are present on facebook site.

Suppose we want to click all checkbox only site contains 10 checkboxes and two input field.
We have to identify checkboxes
Like
List<WebElement> check=driver.findElemets(BY.xpath(//input[@type=’Checkbox’]));
//here checkbox tag name is input when give//input then we get 12 matching i.e. 10 checkbox and 2 input field so here we don’t use // input because it also have two input filed also but we only want to perform actions on checkboxes so here we have to filter it out like by using xpath by attribute   like //input[@type=’checkbox’] so it will give all only checkbox now this our multiple matching xpath we have to pass it and store in object i.e. check and its return type is List<WebElement>
So to click every check box we make use of for each loop
for(WebElement O: check)
{
o.click();
Thread.sleep(2000);
}
// here we are clicking check box one by one by using for each loop we give check i.e. object name of List<WebElement> which contains multiple address or lost of information and that info is storeing in O variable and then we are perform click operation on that by using WebElement method click().
Suppose we want size then we use 
int size=check.size();
syso(size); // return size. size() method of List which return how many address are stored in object i.e. check.
 When we use for each loop then it executes statement only in forward direction.
Suppose we want to select check box in forward direction and deselect these checkboxes in backward directions then we use for loop. There is no method available for deselect we have to again click on that check box then it will deselect that check box.
 Then we use like
For to select check box we make use of for each loop because it select or execute statements in forward direction only 
for(WebElement o:check)
{
o.click();
Thread.sleep(450);
}
// this will select in forward direction 
As we want to deselect in reverse or backwards directions then we use for loop and give condition as we want to deselect that form backward then we start selecting from last  like
for(int i =check.size()-1;i>=0;i--)
{
check.get(i).click();
Therad.sleep();
}
// here we give last index value of check i.e. object of List<WebElement>  like i=check.size()-1 i.e. 9 which is last index then end number condition as we want to click  till first check box then decrement operation. Then use check.get() method which fetch value or address present at specific index then we call click() to click the check box.
Handling of Auto suggestions 
Auto suggestions means when we search then we get some auto suggestions when we enter some character.
Like suppose when we enter redmi then we get all suggestion regarding readmi and this suggestion are comes on how people are searching this suggestion positions are not fix day by day its position is changing.
Suppose when we search redmi no google seach then many suggestions are comes and we want to click on redmi 10 prime this suggestion positions are changing daily so but we want click on redmi 10 prime then in this case we have to identify all options available in suggestion and we have to cerate multiple matching xpath and we have to provide this multiple matching xpath as an input to findElements () and then we identify all elements and we get one element one by one then we convert it into text and compare that text with our expected text.  When provide multiple matching xpath then it will identify each element and stored in List<WebElement> object the we will get one by one element from that object and we get text from that and compare that text with expected text when expected text and actual text is get match then we  click on that option.
How to find multiple matching xpath for auto suggestion.
To find multiple matching xpath first we have to inspect any one options then we have to navigate to parent by using keyboard 
Up key when all options are get highlight then that element is parent and options are child of that parent . By identifying parents we can find multiple matching xpath.  All suggestions are immediate chid of parent then we have to navigate them until our desire suggestion get highlighted.
First identify Parent element then we use / for to jump  immediate child i.e. all atuo suggestions options.
By using relative xpah(//) and absolute xpath(/) we are getting multiple matching xpath.
(//ul[@class='G43f7e'])[1]/li
So above its our multiple matching element and pass this as an input in findElements()
List<WebElement> all=findElements(By.xpath(“(//ul[@class='G43f7e'])[1]/li”));
Now we will get each element by using for each loop
String expecttext=”redmi note 10 prime”; //this pxecpted text which we want to click 
//for(WebElement k: all)
//{
//String acttext=k.getText(); // here we are coverting or getting text form webelement 
//}
Now we have expect text and actualttext now we have to compare them by using if control statement and string equals() like
for(WebElement k:all)
{
String acttext=k.getText(); // here we are coverting or getting text form webelement
if(expecttext.equals(acttext)
{
k.click(); //if expected text and actual text match then it will click that element 
break; //this use to break keyword the loop execution after clicking that element.
}
}
This break keyword break/ stop execution for each or any  loop after clicking that element. as we have multiple addresses present in list object  and we are get that elements one by one by using for each loop and we are getting text present at that element and we are comparing that text with  our expected text one by one if both are match then it will click on that element after click on that we want to break the loop that why we are use break keyword here if we don’t use break keyword then this for each loop will continue compare with last element for to stop this we use break key word. (this for each loop compare element for first to end ).

Handling Of Dynamic element
(Some time attribute name/ attribute value / or text present is changing then in that case we have to find )
(in case of dynamic element we have to make use of findElement for single and findElements for multiple element)
Suppose we want to get text present to review and rating this text is continually changing means its dynamic text we cant use xpath by text but we can use xpath by contains text but we only consider numbers which are dynamic means which are changing continues. So this called as dynamic elements which are changing continues.
So to handle dynamic element we have to find dynamic xpath like first we have to inspect that element then we have to navigate to it’s parent until whole that section or i.e. in that case mobile is get highlight mobile and all field
To handle dynamic element we have to jump to parent of that element then we have to jump to any child  by using (//) then we check the index where our element is get highlighted then convert it so this is our dynamic xpath in which text is change then also it perform operation on that dynamic element
((//div[@class='_2kHMtA'])[1]//span)[6]
Whenever we want to find dynamic elements then we have to jump to its parent we have to identify that as we get parent(we have to convert it one on one matching ) then we have to jump to any child then we use // and tagname we jump to any child from parent (we have to convert it in one on one matching )then we will get  our dynamic xpath so if text is change then every time it will perform operation on targeted element.

Like suppose we wan to get rating then we have to find out xpath of that as element is dynamic so we have to find out dynamic xpath first we have to inspect that element then we have to navigate to it’s parent until whole that section or i.e. in that case mobile is get highlight mobile and all field
So parent is which have 24 matching but first mobile is our desired mobile so we have to convert it in single matching then we have to jump to any child by using (//) any child is span by using //like //span then we check on which number rating is present then convert it index which where our element is get highlighted  so we get dynamic xpath in which text present on rating change also then it get text from rating every time it will identify the rating element.
((//div[@class='_2kHMtA'])[1]//span)[6]

In same way we can get the text from or operation or reviews this review is also dynamic then we have to find out so we have to find out dynamic xpath then by using getText we can get text form that.
When element text is changing or attributes are changing and we have to perform operation on that then we have to jump to it parent then form parent to  target element we can navigate by using relative or absolute xpath because tagname never change text or attributes change but tagame are always constant.



Handling of Web Table
Table which is available on web page is called web table. 
Suppose if we want to know that how many row available in that table, how many columns are there, how to fetch data from the row.
1st find Row size in table
Suppose if we want to know to how row are present in row.
To know how many rows are available for that first we have to identify all the row so we have to find multiple matching matching xpath then we pass it in findElements ()method so it will identify multiple row and this returns the List<WebElement> so we can get how many row are present in that table.
1st we have to identify the table 
Like tagname is table and id is countries  so now we navigate to table to tr then all rows are get highlight so tr is any child for table and to navigate to tr first we have to navigate to tbody then tr like
//table[expression ]/tbody/tr or we can directly jump to any child i.e. //table[expression]//tr
//table[@id='countries']/tbody/tr or //table[@id='countries']//tr
Now all row present in table is get highlighted now we send this multiple matching xpath as input to findElements()
Like
List<WebElement> rowsize=driver.findElements(By.xpath(“//table[@id='countries']//tr”)); 
// here we pass this multiple matching xpath to findElements and this method store this elements in object and returns List<WebElement> here it consider each elements as one row for each row we have multiple webElments 
So when call List collection method size() it will return the size i.e. how many elements are present in object of List<WebElement>
Like
Syso(rowsize.size()); //197 row are present here we get row size

So here first we identify table then in that table multiples rows are present so we find Multiple rows multiple matching xpath  so to jump from table i.e. parent to any child i.e. tr we use // here we get multiple matching xpath for all rows then we pass this xpath to findElements () as an input and this findElements () returns the List<WebElement> and all elements are store in one object and here each elements represent on row so when call List<WebElement> object name size() then we get all row present in table
How  to find only rows with out table header?
//table[@class='dataTable']//tr[not(./th)] / or
//table[@class='dataTable']//tr[position()>1]
Find how many column are present in row?
Find column size in a row
Suppose if we want to know how many columns are present in particular column.
First we have to identify the table then we have to decide which rows column size we have to find like suppose we want to find column present in row[3] then we have to first navigate to row no. 3 i.e.  first we have to jump from table to tr i.e. //table//tr now all rows are get highlight then we give row no. i.e. index like // table//tr[3]  in []  so now row is highlight  so now in this row 3 there are many columns available then we have to navigate to tr to td like //table//tr[3]/td now all column are get highlights so now we get multiple matching xpath i.e.
//table[@id='countries']//tbody/tr[5]/td 
List<WebElement> Col= m.findElements(By.xpath("//table[@id='countries']//tbody/tr[5]/td"));
System.out.println(esd.size());
So  we have pass this multiple matching xpath to findElements() as an input and return type of this findElements() is List<WebElement> and elements are store in object of List<WebElement> so each element present columns present in that particular row. Now we get size means how many element present in object of List<WebElment> by using method size() we will get size of column present in row.
We can directly find size like 
int s = m.findElements(By.xpath("//table[@id='countries']//tbody/tr[5]/td")).size();
		System.out.println(s);

== this part return List<WebElement>  so by using size we get size directly.
 In case we have to find first row in column size then we have to use th instead of td because all are headers or /td/h3
Like
//table[@id='countries']//tbody/tr[1]/td/h3 
For headers.
	int sds = m.findElements(By.xpath("//table[@id='countries']//tbody/tr[1]/td/h3")).size();
	
	System.out.println(sds); // return size i.e. 5

Print data available in column?
Suppose we want to print data then first we have to identify the table then first row are consider and then columns 
So first we have to jump to table to row now row have multiple column then we have to jump to column like. //table//tr[8]/td[4]
//table[@id='countries']//tr[8]/td[4]
So here we identity single element then we have to use of findElements() and we have to pass this xpath as and input return type of findElement() is WebElement and as we want to print data present on this column then we use getText() and we get our desired output.
	String text = m.findElement(By.xpath("//table[@id='countries']//tr[8]/td[4]")).getText();
	
	System.out.println("Currency :"+text); //here we get text i.e. 
Currency: Argentine Peso

We can get header text also so it’s is present in 1st row and there are many column and this columns are not normal column is all are header i.e.th so xpath is like
//table//tr[1]/th[2]
Suppose if we want to get text form multiple element then we have to find multiple matching element’s in findElements () then one by one we get that text present on that element.
Different Types of Exception in Selenium?

1.	WebDriver Exception:
URL is not proper way.
Means if we enter wrong URL or format of URL is wrong while opening web page like if we enter like wwwww. Or / s missing . if pattern of URL is wrong while opening web application then we get WebDriver Exception.
This exception indicates a general error in the WebDriver or browser. It can occur when the URL is incorrect or if there is an issue with the WebDriver setup..
2.	Unreachable browser Exception :
When we interrupt the browser while running the test script then we will get unreachable exception.
When we run test script and when it’s running and in between that if we perform any other action on browser then we get this Unreachable browser exception. Like suppose test script selecting radio button and we are entering value or click on other element. 
When we disturbing running test script manually then we get this  Unreachable browser Exceptions.
3.	unhanded alert Exception:
Alert pop up display and perform the action on browser.
Means alter pop up is present on browser and we don’t switch alert pop up and try to perform action on alert pop element or alert pop up is present and we don’t handle that alert pop up by selenium and are try performing action on main page then we get this  unhanded alert Exception.
Some time if think its hidden division pop up and we perform operation on that  but actually it’s an alert pop up then we get this exception i.e. unhandled alert Exception.
This exception is thrown when there is an unexpected alert present on the page, and the script tries to perform an action on the main page without handling the alert. It is important to switch to the alert and handle it before interacting with other elements
4.	NO alert present Exception:
Without alert pop up we perform an other pop up 

Some time if think that alert pop up is present and perform action on that but actually it’s not present then also we switch to alert and try to perform action then we get this no alert present Exception.
This exception occurs when the script tries to interact with an alert that is not present on the page. It can happen if the script assumes the presence of an alert when it is not actually present.
5.	Unexpected tag name exception 
When want to select option present on list box if the select tag name is present then we cerate object of select class and pass webElement object as an input and then by using select class object.selectclass method we can select the option present on list box we can only use select class method to select option present on list only when select tag name is present if select tag name is not present an then also we are using select class method to select option on list box then in this case we get this unexpected tag name exception.
If we try to handle customized list box with help of select class method then we get expection i.e. Unexpected tag name exception.
By using actions and key we can handle customized list box.
: This exception is raised when attempting to select an option from a list box using the Select class method, but the expected select tag is not found. The Select class is specifically designed for handling <select> tags, and using it on other elements will result in this exception.
6.	Unsupported operation exception
When we try to perform deselect operation on single selected list box then we get this unsupported operation exception.
7.	No such element exception
When HTML code is wrong to identify element or because of synchronization 
We get this exception in multiple situation like element is present in frame and we don’t switch to frame and try to perform option on that element then in this case we get this  no such element exception.
Suppose element is present in child browser pop and  we don’t switch to that pop up try to perform action on that then we get this  no such element.
Suppose our xpath /i.e. locator is  wrong then we get this exception  no such element.
Or xpath is dynamic which changing frequently then we get this exception no such element.
If we don’t perform synchronization like we are redirects form one page to another and we don’t add selenium wait i.e. implicitly wait then also we can get this exception. i.e.  no such element.(some time to load page it takes some time but if we don’t add wait then then selenium perform action directly before page get loaded ).
This exception occurs when an element cannot be found on the web page. It can be due to incorrect HTML code, synchronization issues, or using incorrect locators (such as XPath) to locate the element.
1.	NoSuchElementException: Thrown when an element cannot be found on the web page. This usually occurs when trying to interact with an element that is not present or not visible.
2.	TimeoutException: Thrown when a specific operation or action takes longer than the specified time limit. For example, waiting for an element to be visible or clickable.
3.	ElementNotVisibleException: Thrown when trying to interact with an element that is present in the DOM but not currently visible on the web page.
4.	StaleElementReferenceException: Thrown when an element is no longer attached to the DOM or has become stale. This can happen if the element is removed from the DOM or the page is refreshed.
5.	ElementClickInterceptedException: Thrown when another element overlaps the element that is being clicked, preventing the click action.
NoSuchWindowException: 
Thrown when attempting to switch to a window or frame that does not exist or has been closed.
6.	InvalidElementStateException: Thrown when trying to perform an action on an element with an invalid state or incorrect state.
7.	UnhandledAlertException: Thrown when an unexpected alert is present on the page and not handled.
8.	WebDriverException: A general exception that indicates an error in the WebDriver or browser.

FRAMEWORK
What is framework for now?
It is set of rule which is made by us and we have to follow that by doing this we can make reusability of code and reduce the possibility of duplicate code and reduce length of code.
a framework is a set of guidelines, standards, and reusable components that provide a structured approach to designing and implementing test automation solutions. It acts as a foundation for organizing test scripts, managing test data, handling test execution, and generating test reports.
Reusability of code means suppose we have 100 test case which is designed in 100 class each class contain one test case. So each class have code present to open browser and we are entering URL. Suppose  after some sprint application URL is change then we have to update that URL in class 100 classes. So we have to mention this type of code in one class which we have to use many time and if there is change made in that then we need to much time to fix that then  by writing that code in each class instead of that we have to declare that code for to open browser in method in separate class and then we extend that class/ or we can just call that method to other class then by just calling that method we can perform that task and but code is present at one location and we are calling that code again and again to carry out our task and if we have situation to change that code then we have to update that code in class but it will reflecting in all classes. By donning this we can reduce the length of code also and we can make reuse that code also.
If there is repeated code then we reduce it length and we reuse that code.
It is set of rule which is made by us and we have to follow that by doing this we can make reusability of code and reduce the possibility of duplicate code and reduce length of code.
There are different type of framework which are :
There are many framework available in market but these three are mainly us.
1.	Data driven Framework 
2.	Keyword driven
3.	Hybrid framework
In our project we are using data driven framework.
Framework means it is set of rule which is made by us and we have to follow that by which we can reuse the code, we can reduce length of code and we can reduce possibility duplicate code.
There are two type of test case test case in which frame work is not use and test case in which frame work is used.
Code where in which we don’t make use of data driven framework  is called as code or script without data driven script.  
We don’t make use of frame work to write test script then it is called test script without ddf.
Test Script having / containing test data (input) then it is example of  without DDF.
Like we have application saucedemo.com we have to login in it and we have to verify the logo of that application is logo is present or not means it show that we are successfully login in to system and then we have to verify the logo is present or not then is log is present then we have to log out from that system.
Here we don’t fetch data from external file we pass test data in test script then this is example of test script without DDF.
When test script having test data also then it meaning that no framework is used.
Test data means input which are required to run automation script is called test data.
Test script containing  test data within itself then its script without DDF.
1.	Data Driven framework
In data driven  frame work test script are speared from test data(input). In  test script are separated from test data(input) which is stored in excel sheet. Then we have to fetch  that test data in test script is called data driven framework.


 
If test script and test data is separate then is called data driven framework.
Example with Data driven framework.
 Then we have to pass test data from excel sheet. For that we have to fetch the data from excel sheet i.e. user name and password for that we have to create object of FileInputStream class then we have to pass excel file path as input then we have to call create () of workbookfactory class which is static method. then we pass object name of FileInputStream class then this will open that excel file the we have to call getSheet () to open specific sheet then we have to pass sheet name as input and then we have to call getRow() then we have to pass index value then we have to call getCell() then we have to pass cell index and then we have to call getStringCellValue() method to fetch string data then we have to store this in variable which type is String and then we have to pass this input to sendkeys() for user name and then again we have to fetch data for password again we have to stored in variable then we have to pass that variable as input to sendkeys() method which only accept String input. 
//enter UN
		String username = sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@placeholder='Username']")).sendKeys(username);
		
		//enter pwd
		String password = sh.getRow(0).getCell(1).getStringCellValue();
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@placeholder='Password']")).sendKeys(password);

					OR 
We can directly fetch test data from excel in sendKey() method which only accept String input and this Cell is also returning String 

		//enter UN
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@placeholder='Username']")).sendKeys(sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue());
		
		//enter pwd
		driver.findElement(By.xpath("//input[@placeholder='Password']")).sendKeys(sh.getRow(0).getCell(1).getStringCellValue());
		
here we fetch the data from excel then we store it in variable and then we pass this variable as an input to sendeKeys() here sendKeys() method only accept String value and variable is also containing String so we will directly pass it to sendKeys() as an input.
Or 
We can directly fetch data from excel sheet in sendKeys() also because this method i.e. getStringCellValue() and this method is also return String value.
Like
driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”)).sendKeys(sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue());

Definition of Data driven framework :
Framework means set of rule which is written by us and we have to follow that by which we can reuse code, reduce length of code and reduced the possibility of duplicate code.
Data driven frame work is method/approach of separating test data from test script /test case.
Once the test data is separated from test case/test script, it can easily modified for a specific functionality without changing the code.
Means once we separated test data from test case then when we have situations like we have to change data or modify then we can easily modify that data in excel we don’t have need to make change in code.
It is used to fetch test data from external file like excel. (we are storing test data in excel sheet)

 

What is Selenium Framework? Types of Framework?
 	The Selenium Framework is a code structure that makes code maintenance easy and efficient.
  	Without frameworks, users may place the “code” and “data” at the same location which is neither reusable nor readable. 
	Frameworks produce beneficial outcomes like increased code reusability, higher portability,
	 reduced cost of script maintenance, better code readability, etc.

        There are mainly three type of frameworks created by Selenium WebDriver to automate manual test cases

	1. Data Driven Framework(DDF)
	2. Keyword Driven
	3. Hybrid

1. Data Driven
	Data Driven Framework in Selenium is a method of separating Test data from the test case.
	Once the Test data are separated from the test case, it can be easily modified for a specific functionality without changing the code. 
	It is used to fetch Test Data from external files like Excel, .csv, .xml or some database tables.



When we are design manual test case to test scripts then we have to use script design technique. i.e. Page Object module pattern technique. Page object module with pageFactory is used to design test script.
Is also called POM with pageFactory.
To know this concept we have to know then encapsulation.
Encapsulation 
It one of OOPs principle in  encapsulation hiding data/class member  of one class from another class the we make use of encapsulation.
So to hide that class member we have to declare it with private access specifier.
Like suppose we have one global variable i.e. int a and then we provide it value or initialize within constructor having scope of constructor is public.
And then by using non static regular method we can perform action on that variable. like to print.
But we can’t run this method because main method is not present in this class then we create another class with main method within it. and then we call this non static regular method so for that first we have to create of that class where non-static method is present i.e. demo then   when we call this method in  in demo1 now we can access that variable which is present in demo class because it scope is default means in we can access that variable in other classes present in packages we . Like object.variablename we can access it.
// create object demo class 
demo o=new demo();
syso(o.a) // o is objectname and a global variable present in demo class here we can access it

but if we want to restrict scope of this variable then we have to declare it private.
When we declare one of the variable private then the scope of that variable is remain only within that class only out side that class we can access it.
Like when we try to access that variable outside class then it don’t give permission.
Encapsulation means hiding data from other classes using private access specifier is called encapsulation. When we want to hide that from other class then we have to declare that member of class as private then we don’t get access of that member out side class in other classes. 
In encapsulation there are three rules which are 
Hiding data from other classes using private access specifier is called encapsulation.
1.	Data member/variable should be declared globally with private access specifiers.
We have to Declare variable globally  by using private access specifier.(global means out side method)
 When we declare any variable/member then we declare that variable as private.
Like 
private int a;

2.	 Initialize within constructor using public access specifier.
Here we initialize global variable within constructor with by using public access specifier.
And we have to provide value within constructor and we have to declare constructor scope public  
Like
public demo() //public is access specifier demo () it is constructor i.e. classname(); 
{
a=10;
} 
3.	Utilize within a method with public access specifier 
Use within method with public access specifier
We have to used it in method and scope of method should be public. 
The variable which is we declare  and initialize then to used that variable in method using public access specifier.
(this three rule are important to perform encapsulation).

( we should have to declare data member/variable as private globally , method as public, constructor as public to carry out encapsulation).
(we give variable as private because there is condition that we have to use that variable in only within that class. But the constructor and method which we are using there scope is remain throughout the project so in any package we can use it that why we mention in or declare with public ).
Encapsulation concept:
	Hiding data from other classes using private access specifier is called encapsulation. 

		1. Data member/variable should be declared globaly with access level private 
		2. Initialize within a constructor with access level public 
		3. Utilize within a method with access level public

In POM every web  element is consider as  variable then many web page have same element as so to avoid confusion we hide it there. 
In POM we consider each element as separate variable like if there are 50 elements then we consider that one element as one variable means we have 50 variable present on that web page.
Some time 2-3 web page contain same variables so to avoid confusion so for that we are giving access to that method by using public access specifier and we hide variable. 
 This same concept we are going to use in Page Object Module.

Page Object Module (POM)
 POM (Page Object Module )
It is java design pattern use for design of classes in Test script.
It is script design pattern to convert manual test case into Test Script. We use Page Object Module i.e.
Page Object model is an object design pattern in selenium , where
Some important rule of POM is
1.	Web pages are represented as POM classes ( regular classes ) 
Regular classes means in which main method is not present. Class which contain main method is called main class or Test classes.
we have to create POM classes for each web pages present in manual test case.
Like suppose we have one test case how many pages are present there we page to create POM classes / regular classes for each web page.
Like suppose we have test case like we have to login to SWAGLABS then we have to verify log then we have to logout from there. So to perform this test case we have to navigate to 3 web page i.e. 1st is login page then 2nd is home page where we have to identify logo then we have to click on open menu option so this is 3rd page i.e. open menu page it also contain some option and we have to click on logout. So here we are navigating of 3 pages so here we have to create 3 POM classes.
First we have to execute manual test case in that step 1 how many pages are there we have to create POM classes for each web page.
Like here we cerate 3  POM classes for because we are navigate on 3 web page  
 Like we have to cerate POM classes which is Name of application 
1.	POM class for SWAGLABLogin Page (APPname_Functionlity_Page(page is represent POM class i.e. regular class)
2.	 POM Class for SWAGLABHomePage
3.	POM Class for SWAGLABOpenMenuepage
When read name of class then we get idea about that class which functionality  it perform.
When class name is end with page then we consider that as POM Class / regular class. POM class for login.
2.	Various element present on the web Page are defined as variable on the POM classes.
Means on each web page all element present on that particular web page is consider as variable  and element which are performing action and we have to defined in POM class. 
(if there are may element available but we have to select  / defined those element which we are required to perform that test cases we will defined that element in POM class as an Variable.)
  Like 
Suppose on 1st POM class there are 3 elements available which are user name, password and login button so we have to define this three element as variable on 1st POM class which is for login 
Like element present page 1 i.e. POMLogin
private WebElment UN;
private WebElement PASS;
private WebElement LoginBtn; 
// here  all are web page element so we have to use WebElement  as data type while declaring variable.(here we are performing action on 3 element then only declare 3 elements as variable.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Element present on Home page i.e. 2nd POM class are here we are perform action on 2 element which are logo and OpenMenu option so we declare two element as variables like 
WebElement logo;
private WebElement Option_menu;
// WebElement is used because all variable are element present on web and return type is webElement.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then we have to declare variable present on 3rd page on which we have to perform operation. i.e. logo out then we declare it as variable in 3rd POM class like
private WebElement logout;
// here we are performing action on one element only i.e. we declare that element as variable.
(first we have to execute test case manually because we have to ensure that all element are automatable or not suppose we have test we have to perform 10 test but on 9th step  there is captcha is there then we want automate that test case. Means once we have to test  that test case manually  to ensure that automation is possible or not on that test case.)

Here we create POM classes for each webpage and then we declare all element in each POM classes on which we have to perform action on that.
Then 
In this case we will used PageFactory Class to initialize web elements that are defined in web page classes or page Object i.e. POM
We have declare element globally but by declaring only we cant perform cation on that  we have to initialize that variable  for that we have to make use pageFactory class.
1st step we declare element as variables   
To initialize variable we have to use pageFactory class which in build class in   selenium we have to use this class for initialization or variable.

POM(page object module pattern) Strictly follow encapsulation concept  in which there are three steps which are
Step1 :  data member should be declared globally with private access specifiers by using @findBy Annotation 
We have to declare all variable as private globally using @findBy Annotation. 
In Java Annotation concept  is available in java which like Class  and to call the Annotation we have to make use @ sign. Annotation contain name like @findBy when we call that Annotation along with @ sign in which there is inbuild code available when call then it will execute internally @findBy is an Annotation we have to make use @ sign to call Annotation. (Like when we call non static method we have to cerate object then object name.methodname we can call it, like when we call static method of different class then classname.methodename() we can call that method that same way we have to make use @Annootaion to call Annotation). 
So in @findBy Annotation it contain driver.findElement code is present in @fidnBy Annotation(i.e. WebDriverObejce.findeElement)  (for now when we call @findBy Annotation then we don’t have to call WebDriverObejct.findElement this code is internally in @findBy Annotation)
so for that we have to use this @findBy before the variable then we have to pass locator i.e. @findBy(xpath=””) then we have to add expression for xpath. Like suppose we want id then we can add id locator also for that we have to pass id value. 
Step1: Declaring variable globally as private with private access specifier using @findBy Annotation.
@findBy(xpath=“expression”)private WebElement UN;
@findBy(xpath=“expression ”)private WebElement PASS;
@findBy(xpath=“expression ”)private WebElement  LOGINbtn;

Here @ is used for calling Annotation name is findBy  so it internally contain driver.findElement(i.e. WebDriveobject.findElemennt) then we are passing locator i.e. xpath and it expression now it can identify element and store that element address in variable. 
now we design each POM class completely means we have to declare all variable as private globally.
Now here declaration is done now we have to initialize within constructor having public access specifier using pageFactory Class.
Step2 : Initialize within constructor with access specifier public using pageFactory Class. 
we have to initialize global variable within constructor and scope of constructor is public using pageFactory class.
 So here to initialize there is class present in selenium i.e. pageFactory. Then we have to call this class static method i.e. initElements(fatory,page) which accept two  parameter i.e.  WebDriverobejct and 2nd parameter is this keyword is used to call global variable allow user to use that fields in the page object to interact with the element on the test page. Like we have to call this static method in static way i.e.
pageFactory.initElements(factory,page);  // here pageFactory is class name initElements()  is static element of pageFactory class which accept two input i.e. 1st input is webdriverobject and 2nd is input is this keyword.
pageFactory.initElements(WebDriverobject,this);
( here we don’t cerate object of WebDriver so for now WebDriverobject is now available for now. But in java we know there is constructor is available in all classes there are different types of constructor i.e. default constructor, user defined constructor, constructor with zero parameter and constructor with parameter.) so here to provide value to global variable we don’t have information so then we accept that information through constructor 
In initialization it convert @findBy annotation to it to findElement().

Like
Here we have global variable we are provide it value in constructor 
int a;
int b;
public class(int num1,int num2)
{
 a=num1;
b=num2;
}
Here value is not directly provide in constructor so it accept from user then that value is assign to global variable. Here current class value is not available but is accepting value when we carte object of that class then it ask for input then that input is provided or assign to global variable.
Here we have to provide value to global variable and we are providing that value in constructor for that we are using pageFactory class static method i.e. initElements() by calling this method but we have to pass WebDriverObject As an input and this keyword so we provide this keyword directly but currently we don’t have WebDriverobject so now we can accept is through constructor  and then we pass that WebDriverObject to method as an input like 
public class(WebDriver objectname)
{
pageFactory.initElements(objectname,this);
}
// here meaning is in current class WebDriverobject is not available so we will accept  it through constructor and this object is send to initElements() as an input.
Like as how we can accept String value and int value through constructor that same way we accept WebDriver object / we can accept object also. by constructors  and method .
So here constructor accepting WebDriver Object and that object is sent as an input to pageFactory.initElements(). Now  this object is pass to  @findBy so now it internally it will convert findBy as an statement. So internally it change this statement 
@findBy(xpath(“expression”))private WebElement UN; 
To 
Private WebElement UN=driver.findElement(xpath(“”);
So to each variable is converted in above format.
In initialization it convert @findBy annotation to it to findElement(). When it get converted then we can call method and perform action on element.

Here we declare variable globally with private access with using @findBy and we have to pass locator and then we have to initialize all global variable in constructor  which scope is public and then we have to use of pageFactory class static method i.e. initElements() we have to pass two element which is WebDriverObject and 2nd parameter is this keyword. As here we don’t have WebDriver object available so we have to accept that object from where which we are creating object of this class and so we  accept that Webdriver object form that class we pass it to constructor   so for that we have to cerate constructor with parameter i.e. we have give parameter i.e. WebDriver object and we pass that object as a input to initElements(WebDriverObejct,this ) so that object also pass it initialize variable   in @findBy annotation so in initialization it cover that variable in statement internally like
private WebElement UN=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”));
when it converted like declaration and initialization is done then we can use it method to perform action on that.
Step3: usage here create one method for one variable 
Like if we have 3 variable then we three method one method for one variable.
Like suppose we want to enter user name then we create method for that
public void username()
{
UN.sendKeys(“userame”); // here we call variable name then we call it method to pass data in it .
}
public void password()
{
PASS.sendKeys(“password”); // here we call variable and we call method to pass data in it.
}
All steps are same for all POM (page object module)
In initialization it convert @findBy annotation to it to findElement().

So here we have all POM classes done with declaration initialization and usage in method but main method is not available then we have to cerate one test Class with main method.
We have to create test class in which main method is present and code is present to open browser also 
	Note:
		1. No of Data Member that need to be created under a pom class will depends on no of element that need to be handle in a webpage.(we have to define variable in POM Class on which we have to perform action)
		2. pom class will not contain a main method, to run a pom class we require another class with main() i.e. Test class.
		3. Test class will contain all the navigation steps to test an application(in test class we call the method in step manner all this are navigation step.)

Test Class/main class
We gave Test at end for just identify that it is test class in which main method is present and code is also available for to open browser. 
In this class we can call multiple POM class. 
For to identify POM class we give page and for to identify test class we give Test at end. 
 So now we have to write all code to open browser and all.
Now to login we have to create object of login class
SWAGLABLOGINPAGE login=new SWAGLABLOGINPAGE(driver); here we have to pass driver as an input then it pass in initiElement().

Now we call all method present in that POM class all are non static so we have to call obejctname.methodname() like
login.username();
login.password();
login.loginbutton();
 now then we create object of all class then and call method of that classes in same way.
Every time we have to pass driver as an input at time  object creation to constructor if don’t provide then it show error and if we don’t send then it don’t go in constructor and if don’t go in constructor then initialization is not done as well as method also don’t run. 
Now control is pass no home page then we have to create home page object then we have to pass object as an input and then we have to call that class method. 
By using this approach we can reuse this code. This approach is followed to design script or framework.
Annotation is not class in separate class different Annotation is created like method we can call method by classname.methodname so in case of Annotation @Annotation this @findBy Annotation is created in support class available in selenium many Annotation is available there.

POM with pagefactory

POM(page object module):
	IT is a java design pattern use for design of classes in Test script. 

	Page Object model is an object design pattern in Selenium, where
		1. Web pages are represented as pom classes(regular class) &
		2. The various elements on the webpage are defined as variables on the pom class.
	In this case we will use PageFactory class to initialize web elements that are defined in web page classes or Page Objects.


	POM Strictly follows encapsulation concept where
		1. Data member should be declared globaly with access level private using @findBy Annotation
		2. Initialize within a constructor with access level public using pagefactory class
		3. Utilize within a method with access level public

	Note:
		1. No of D.M. that need to be created under a pom class will depends on no of element that need to be handle in a webpage.
		2. pom class will not contain a main method, to run a pom class we require another class with main() ie. Test class
		3. Test class will contain all the navigation steps to test an application

Note:
		1. No of D.M. that need to be created under a pom class will depends on no of element that need to be handle in a webpage.
		2. pom class will not contain a main method, to run a pom class we require another class with main() ie. Test class
		3. Test class will contain all the navigation steps to test an application



Pagefactory:
he PageFactory class is a utility class in Selenium that provides various methods for initializing Page Objects. One common method is initElements(), which takes the WebDriver instance and the Page Object class as parameters.
	It is a class which contains static method like initElements.
pageFactory is class present in selenium which have method like initElements() which used to initialize the elements. This initElements() is used to initialize/to provide values to  all global variable i.e. elements. 
pageFactory.initElements(driver,this); 
•	driver: It is the instance of the WebDriver class that is used to interact with the web browser.
•	this: It refers to the current instance of the Page Object class that needs to be initialized.

when we send driver to this method then that driver is send in @findBy Annotation i.e. global variable when we driver is send to @findby Annotation then it will covert statement from @findBy to WebElement ob=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”)); i.e. @findBy to findElement. Once then statement conversion is done then we called it as initialization. Here in Page object  initalizations means we convert @findBy Annotation to findElelemnt statement. This iniatization is done by initElements().
	To initialize global variable in PageFactory we need to use initElements method within the constructor.
	Syntax:
		PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);

	initElements will initialize D.M by identifying each component present in a webpage by using @findBy annotation,
	which takes locator type as an input. 	
Here we send locator as an input to @findBy then it will check that is that elements is present or not before checking it covert statement(here iniatlziation is meaning is statement conversion from @findBy annotation to findElement. This only working of pageFactory  class method i.e. initElements().
	Syntax:
		@FindBy(locator Type ="locator value/exression")
		private WebElement D.M. ;


Working of PageFactory:
Working of page factory class is in two steps like 
when create object of POM class in test class/main class it is basic initialization. When we call method then it late initialization 

	1. While executing Test Script initElement method will convert all the data members @findBy annotation to findElement(),
	   this process is known as basic/early initialization this will done after creating object of pom class
	        @FindBy(xpath="//span[text()='KV']") private WebElement PN;    
		----> private WebElement PN = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//span[text()='KV']"));
When we create object of POM class in test class then we send driver as an input then this driver is send in constructor then that driver is send to initElements() now this driver is pass in @findBy Annotation then it will convert @findBy Annotation to findElement i.e.
private WebElemnt om= driver.findElemnt(By.xpath(“”));
Is called as Basic or early initialization. When we just create object of POM class is called basic or early initialization. When we just create object then statement conversion is done i.e. all variable are @findBy  converted to findElement.
It don’t check that element is present or not it just convert statement.
private WebElement PN = driver.findElement(By.xpath("//span[text()='KV']"));

	2. To perform action on component we need to call a methods.
To perform action we need to call methods of POM class. 
Like suppose when we call UN () then controller go in body of UN method in that body it will check That UN variable i.e. webElment i.e. alredy coverted in findElement i.e. UN
private Weblement UN=driver.findElemnt(By.xpath(“”));
now by using user name element it will perform action on that element i.e. it input user name .
here when we call method then it check that xpath is correct /element is present   or not for that Element. this will only identify element which method we call. It will identify element which method we call and it perform action on that.(other element is not identify like we call method UN then it only identify User name field other like password and login button is identify this.
Late/lazy initialization means method which we call it will go inside body of and element which we mention in that method it will find out that element and then it check that element is present on webpage or not or xpath is correct or not if present then it will perform action that.
	3. Before performing each action initElement method will identifies component present or not,
	   then it will do complete initialization  
	   this process is known as late/lazy initialization. ---->after method call
in late or lazy initialization when we call method then it will go inside method body and then variable or element present in method is check that element is present or not or xpath is correct or not then it will perform operation on that is element is present it will check for that particular method element .


Simple POM
Early there is simple POM concept  in which we don’t have pageFactory class and @Annotation are  not available.  
There are some limitation in Simple POM class. That why we use POM with pageFactory.
In a simple POM class when we create simple POM  
We have declare element globally in simple POM class pageFactory and @findBy Annotation is not used  like
private WebElement UN;
private WebElement pass;
private WebElement login;
//in constructor we find xpath for driver
Classname(WebDriver driver)
{
UN=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”));
UN=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”));
UN=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“”));
}
public void un()
{
UN.sendKey(“”);
}
In the simple Page Object Model (POM) approach, we don't have the PageFactory class and the @FindBy annotation available. Instead, we declare the web elements globally in the POM class and initialize them in the constructor or separate methods using driver.findElement().
However, the simple POM has limitations. It initializes all the elements before performing any actions, which can cause issues when dealing with hidden or dynamically displayed elements. For example, if a web page has fields like username, password, and a login button, where the login button is hidden until the username and password fields are filled, the simple POM may throw a "No such element" exception because it initializes the elements during object creation and the login button is not visible at that time.
To overcome this limitation, we use the POM with PageFactory. It is an extension of the simple POM and provides the PageFactory class and the @FindBy annotation. With PageFactory, we can initialize all the web elements using a single method call, PageFactory.initElements(driver, this), which initializes all the global variables present in the POM class. This approach allows lazy initialization of elements, meaning the elements are located and assigned only when they are accessed or interacted with in the test code. By using PageFactory, we can handle hidden or dynamically displayed elements more effectively and reduce the complexity of element initialization.
Overall, the POM with PageFactory is preferred in real-time projects as it provides better control over element initialization, improves code maintainability, and handles dynamic or hidden elements more efficiently compared to the simple POM approach.

This is format of simple POM class here pageFactory and @findBy Annotation is not used and in method we are perform action on one element.
In case of simple POM class When we create Object of simple POM class then we have to pass driver in constructor while creating object so that driver in come in constructor then it will check that xpath of each element is correct or not  / element is present or not. (but in page factory it only perform conversion of statement check after when we call the method then it will check that element is present or not.) if the element is present then only object creation is done if element is not present then object creation is not done it though error that no such element before calling method.(in page factory when we call all method then it check that element is present or not one by one).but in Simple POM when just cerate object then it will check all element is present or not.
Disadvantage of simple POM:
	
Simple POM 
Early there is simple POM concept is there in which we don’t have pageFactory class and @Annotation are  not available.  
There are some limitation in Simple POM class. That why we use POM with pageFactory.
Simple POM will initialize all the component before performing actions(after object creation), 
	but sometimes application may contains few components which will be hidden &
	displayed once we perform action on other components, that hidden component will not be displayed while pom initializing,
(like suppose we have web page which have three field user name ,password and login button when we enter user name and password then only login button is visible/enable to perform action in that case if we use This simple POM class then it throw error because login button is hidden/disable until we add data in two field but in POM call it check that element is present or not at object creation at that time login button is disable so it throw error).
(but in case of hidden element if we used POM with page factory then at time of object creation it only perform statement conversion and when we call method then it check element for that method and one by one we call method then it will check that element is present or not if present then perform action on that. so by using POM with page factory class we can perform action hidden elements also) 
        so it throws "No such element" exception.

	To overcome drawback of simple pom, we need to use "PageFactory" which is an extension of pom.
(pageFactory is extension of POM)
In Simple POM class we have to initialize them one by one in constructor separately .
But In POM with Page factory we can initialize all global variable by using single method i.e.
pageFactory.initElement(driver,this). This will initialize all global variable present in POM class.
(that why we use POM with page factory in Realtime. If we use simple there are some limitation and length of code is more as compare with POM with page factory)


Difference between POM & Pagefactory
			  Simple POM																					Pom with PageFactory
	1. It will initialize/identify all the D.M. present in 			It will initialize/identify the D.M. present in a class before 
	   class completely before performing action on components	        performing each action.

	2. It will use if webpage is not containing hidden elements.		It will be used if webpage is containing hidden elements.
	

POM means Simple POM	POM with PageFactory (page factory means POM with pageFactory)
1.	It will initialize/identify all the data member present in class completely before performing action on components.(in a simple POM class when we create object of simple POM then it will identify all element present on webpage before performing action on that.)	1.	It will initialize/identify the Data member in a class before performing each action (in pageFactory before performing each action we will identify that element) 
2.	We can use simple POM class if web page is not containing hidden element.	3.	It will be used if webpage is containing hidden element.

In real time we don’t use simple POM we only use POM with PageFactory.
Naming convention of POM classes
We have to change  in code of all POM classes.
In all POM classes method we declare we have to give them proper naming convention / we have to follow naming convention for methods.
Like we declare method to enter user name. 
When ever we want enter input then method name should  start with 
1.action which we want to perform by using that method 
Like inp for input 
2.then web page name  on which we are performing action   
Like login page , home page etc. it will which web is this 
3.then we have to give element name on which we are performing action 
Like user name, password ,ect
Like we have to give name to method by combining all convention like   
For username
public void inpSwagLabLoginPageUserName() ;
for verify logo
public void verifySwagLabHomePageLogo();
like this.
Advantages of this naming convention is if in POM class there is many methods are available to pass input then when we call that method like inp then all input or that particular related methods get filtered. We can check that to perform that action is there method available or not we can see it when we call methods. Or if method is not present then we can cerate that method.
Naming conventions in POM classes are important for maintaining consistency and readability in the codebase. Here are some guidelines for naming conventions in POM classes:
1.	Method Naming:
•	Start the method name with an action verb that describes the operation being performed, such as "enter," "click," "verify," "select," etc.
•	Followed by the web page name or section name on which the action is being performed. This helps in identifying the relevant page or section of the application.
•	End the method name with the name of the element or purpose of the action being performed. This provides clarity on the specific element or purpose of the method.
Example:
•	Method for entering the username on the login page: enterLoginPageUsername
•	Method for clicking the submit button on the home page: clickHomePageSubmitButton
•	Method for verifying the presence of a logo on the home page: verifyHomePageLogo
2.	Consistency:
•	Follow a consistent naming convention throughout the POM classes. This helps in easy understanding and maintenance of the code.
•	Use meaningful and descriptive names that accurately represent the purpose and functionality of the method.
By following a consistent naming convention, it becomes easier to locate and understand the methods in the POM classes. It also helps in filtering and identifying the relevant methods when calling them in the test code. Additionally, it promotes code readability and maintainability by providing clear indications of the actions being performed on specific elements.
It's important to adhere to these naming conventions to ensure a standardized approach in the POM classes and facilitate collaboration among team members working on the automation project.

 
In a POM With page factory there are many PM classes and one test class and we store test data in in POM class here one test class handle multiple test classes and in that POM class it contain data within it self also so we call it as POM with pageFactory. 
Now we have to convert this POM in POM with DDf.

POM WITH DDF 
Page object module with page factory with Data Driven Framework.

 
(In a POM With out  page factory there are many PM classes and one test class and we store test data in  in POM class here one test class handle multiple test classes and in that POM class it contain data within it self also so we call it as POM with pageFactory.) 
Now we have to convert this POM in POM with DDF.
In this We handle multiple POM classes in on test class and test input(TEST Data) is fetch from excel sheet so this concept is called as POM with DDF i.e. Data driven Framework. Here test data is fetch from excel sheet in test class and that input are forwarded in multiple test classes.
We get input from excel sheet in test class and that input are forwarded in POM classes. This concept is called POM with DDF.
In POM with DDF we store test data in excel sheet and we fetch that data in test class and we forward that test data in multiple POM classes.

(We have to make changes in existing code.)
First we have to load excel sheet in test class. So to fetch data from excel sheet we have to cerate object fileInputStream call then he have to give path of excel file as an input then we have to call create() method of workbookFactory class then we have to pass FileInputStreamclass object as an input to this method and then to open particular sheet we have to call getSheet() then we have to pass sheet name as input it will open that particular sheet.
Like
FileInputStream file=new FileInputStream(“excelpath”);
Sheet sh =WorkbookFactory.create(file).getSheet(“sheetname”);
Now we fetch data form excel sheet 1st we need input in user name field so have to fetch user name then we call code to fetch user name form sheet before calling username() method
String username=sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue();
Now here we stored string input in username variable. 
Now we have to send this information which is stored in variable as input to username method.
But for now in Login page POM class username() is method without parameter so it will not accept parameter or input.
In this method we directly given input but now we have to pass input from fetching excel sheet and then we have to pass that input as an input to sendKeys(). So for that we convert this method with parameter like
Public static void inpSwagLabUsername(String username)
{
UN.sendKeys(username);
}
Here we input which we are getting that input is pass an input to sendeKeys().
Now this method is converted into method with parameter.
Now when we call this method with parameter in test class then we have to pass input to this method.
Here as we store data which is we fetch from excel sheet in variable and that variable is sent as an input to method.( here variable is not pass forward but the information which is stored in that variable is pass forward as an input) here information is passed to method as an input this information is sent in POM call as an input then this information is send to sendKeys().
Now as we have to enter pass also then we also fetch password form excel sheet and we have to convert pass method in POM class from method without parameter to method with parameter then this method can accept input then pass information which store in variable as an input and then this information is forwarded in POM class password method as an input that input is now pass to sendKeys() then will enter password.
Now script is completely converted in POM with DDF.
Here we are getting all input which we are need for script from excel sheet. Input which we are need that input is fetch in Test class then which POM class method we are pass that information as an input then that information is passed to POM class then it will send that input to element.(we can minimize that code just fetching data in method () which we have to send input like username(sh.getRow(0).getStringCellValue) directly it also work same.

We create the POM classes for small test case. Because the code which we are declared in POM class we can reuse that code. 
Like supposed we have next script which is we have to click on add to cart option on home page  and we have to verify that after click on that button is converted to RMOVE button or not.
Now scenario is we have to click on add to cart option then we have to check that after clicking it converting into REMOVE button or that for that we have get text from REMOVE button and we have to compare that text with expected text if it match then we pass that test cases other wise we fails that test case.
Here we have already code available for login so we can reuse that code and we also how code available for home page also means as we want to perform action home page element then we add that element on Home page POM class as an variable and we will declare methods also to perform action on that elements like
1st variable declaration
@findBy(xpath=””) private WebElement Addtocart; // after clicking on adtcart it change to remove so we have to find element for that also.
@findBy (xpath=””) private WebElement Rmove;
For initialization we use pageFactory class method i.e. initElements() so it will directly provider value to element that it make statement conversion.
Classname(WebDriver driver)
{
pagaFactory.initiElements(driver,this);
}  

public void clickSwagLabHomePageAddToCart()
{
Addtocart.sendkeys();
}
public void verifySwagLabHomePageRemove(String expTxt)
{
String act= remove.getText();
if(expTxt.equals(actTxt)
{
Syso(“pass”);
}
Else
{
Syso(“fail”);
}

Now here are getting expected text from excel then we store that expected text in variable and that variable is pass an input to verifySwagLabHomePageRemove() then this variable information is pass to POM class then that information is send to expTxt if both text match then it show result pass otherwise it show fail.
And we can call logout code also to perform logout from system here are reuse login code then home page codes as well we can use open menu POM class codes also so 
By using POM with PageFactory we can reuse code as well as we can reduce the duplicate code and length of code is also reduce.
Advantages of POM:
1)	Makes the code reusable
We can use multiple time / reusability of code in many classes. Here are we break each code to perform action on each element we are creating one method for one element.
Each element have separate method available to perform action on that.
2)	It is useful in reducing code duplication
(As we don’t use POM class then again we have cerate duplicate code  for to perform each test case. Or if there is change in element then we have to update in each class but here we have to just update in one class and it reflecting in other classes also.) we declare method for each element so we can call that method in different classes multiple time.
	3) It makes ease in maintaining the code (flow in the UI is separated from verification)-->TestNG
	4) Makes code readable (Methods get more realistic names)
Here we are  follow naming convention for methods like we give action then which webpage and element on which we are performing action so this give clear idea to other person to understand on which webpage on which element we are performing action.
4)	The Code becomes less and optimised   
As we eliminate duplicate code so length of code is also reduce and code also get optimized.


Pom class:
	1. Pom class depends on webpage present in an application.
	2. For each webpage pom class will be created, no of POM class depends on no of webpages present in an application.
	3. In each POM class D.M./variable are created in encapsulation concept by using pagefactory.
	4. No of D.M. created in POM class will depend on no of elements present in a webpage.
	5. each declared D.M. should initialized & utilized in POM class.

Test class:
	1. Test class depends on no of Test cases written by manual Test engineer.
	2. Test class will contains navigation steps & inputs that need to be given to the components/elements.
	3. In test class data/inputs that can be given directly or through external source like Excel sheet.

TestNG
TestNG is java unite framework use for writing /designing of Test classes.
TestNG is a testing framework for Java that is widely used in the software testing industry. It stands for "Test Next Generation." TestNG provides a wide range of features and functionalities that make test automation easier and more efficient.
Here's a short and simple explanation of TestNG:
1.	TestNG Annotations: TestNG uses annotations to define test methods, configurations, and other test-related elements. Annotations like @Test, @BeforeSuite, @AfterMethod, etc., are used to specify the behavior and execution order of test methods.
2.	Test Execution: TestNG allows you to organize your tests into test suites and test cases. It provides parallel test execution capabilities, enabling faster execution by running tests concurrently.
3.	Test Configuration: TestNG provides annotations like @BeforeSuite, @BeforeTest, @BeforeClass, etc., which allow you to define pre-test and post-test configurations. You can set up test data, initialize resources, or perform other setup activities using these annotations.
4.	Data Driven Testing: TestNG supports data-driven testing, where you can execute the same test method with different sets of test data. It provides the ability to parameterize test methods and read data from external sources like Excel or CSV files.
5.	Assertions and Reporting: TestNG includes a rich set of assertion methods for validating expected test results. It generates detailed test reports, including information about test results, failures, and errors. These reports help in analyzing test outcomes and identifying issues.
6.	Integration with Build Tools: TestNG integrates well with build tools like Maven and Gradle, allowing seamless integration into the build process. It can be easily integrated with Continuous Integration (CI) systems for running tests automatically on code changes.
Overall, TestNG simplifies the test automation process by providing a comprehensive set of features for test management, execution, configuration, and reporting. It promotes code reusability, flexibility, and scalability, making it a popular choice among developers and testers for writing robust and efficient test automation scripts.

(TestNG  is java unite framework use for writing and designing Test Classes used in Page object design module.)by using TestNG we can modify test class of page object module.
There are many Advantages of TestNG like it’s generate report’s, we can run multiple classes at same time, we can decided execution flow of test cases also(like there are many test cases available then we can decide priority which run first which run last).
Example of normal Test Class where we don’t use TestNG.
In normal test class we take main method in test class then we give simple code to open browser then we close that browser in main method body. 
Example of Test Class using TestNG
When we make use TestNG Then we don’t need use main method in Test Class. Without main method we run this code for that 
We have to create one regular method which can be static or non-static.
Like 
@Test
public void TC1()
{
System.out.println(“Running Test case 1”);
}
In this method we write our code. 
So now we want to run this method. Then in this case we have to Call Annotation before this regular method i.e. @Test
(When we call @Test First time then it show two error 1st add TestNG library to the project (TestNG is present in eclipse but it not configure with our project so 1st we have to configure it with our project when we click on TestNG It will added in our Project) 
2nd time is also given error now we have to import Test we have to handle this two error now We can use @Test in our project.
Now By using @Test Annotation we can run regular method i.e. which we create for test cases.
For now we don’t use main method in Test /TestNG we use @Test Annotation which internally contain main method within it. now we declare code in regular method and we use @Test annotation before that method then @Test will execute that regular method.
(This @ Test Annotation contain main method internally then it will execute that regular method. @ Annotation contain internal code within it like @FindBy Annotation contain code for findEelemnt () code like same way this @Test Annotation contain main Method code in it.)
We use @Test Annotation and regular method in  Test Class.

Advantages of TestNG 
1.	Rich Annotations: TestNG provides a wide range of annotations such as @Test, @BeforeMethod, @AfterMethod, @DataProvider, etc. These annotations help in organizing and controlling the flow of test execution, allowing for more precise configuration and setup.
2.	Data-Driven Testing: TestNG supports data-driven testing, where you can run the same test with different sets of test data. This is achieved using the @DataProvider annotation, which allows you to supply test data from various sources like Excel, CSV, databases, or custom providers.
3.	Test Dependency Management: TestNG allows you to define dependencies between test methods using the dependsOnMethods attribute. This ensures that certain tests run only after specific prerequisites are met, improving test reliability and reducing maintenance efforts.
4.	Parallel Test Execution: TestNG provides built-in support for parallel test execution. You can configure tests to run concurrently across multiple threads or even on separate machines, significantly reducing the overall test execution time.
5.	Flexible Test Configuration: TestNG allows you to define and manage test configurations using annotations like @BeforeSuite, @AfterSuite, @BeforeTest, and @AfterTest. These annotations help in setting up preconditions, initializing resources, or performing cleanup activities before and after test suites or individual tests.
6.	Test Reports and Logging: TestNG generates detailed test reports that provide comprehensive information about test results, failures, and errors. Additionally, it offers flexible logging capabilities, allowing you to capture detailed logs during test execution for debugging purposes.
7.	Integration with Build Tools and IDEs: TestNG seamlessly integrates with popular build tools like Maven and Gradle, making it easy to incorporate test automation into the build process. It also has excellent support within Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA, providing features like test execution, debugging, and code navigation.
8.	Extensibility and Customization: TestNG offers a plugin-based architecture that allows you to extend its functionality through custom listeners, reporters, and annotations. This extensibility enables you to tailor TestNG to suit your specific testing needs and integrate with other testing frameworks or tools.

When We use TestNG then it will cerate report so we can maintain  that report to our lead/team member.
•	When cerate regular method and use @Test Annotation  in test Class then it is called Test case or Test method. 
•	A method in which  @Test Annotation is present before that method  is called Aa Test method or Test case.
•	Method name indicate the Test Case Name.
(if some one ask how many test Method / test cases are present in a class then we check method in which @Test Annotation is present before that method. if @Test  Annotation is present with 1 method then 1 Test case similarly if 2 method is present with @Test then 2 test cases like that. )
Like
@Test
public void TC1()
{
System.out.println();
}
This method is called as Test method.
•	We can cerate N number test cases in Test classes. (method in which @Test Annotation is present is called Test method)
(if we declare only regular method then that method don’t run. regular method only run if @Test annotation is present with regular method.)


Report in console 
When we run Test method then TestNG generate reports in console. 
•	1st it show messages in console 
•	Then Test case Reports like PASSED or FAILED.
•	Default Test-
Tests Run: number test cases, Failure: number,Skip:0;
•	Default suite-
Total Tests run: number Test cases, Passes, Failures:0, Skips:0
In console it show messages and it show Test cases which are passed and which are fail. It published that test cases name.
Then TestNG also publish
 reports OF Running Class classname 
if we see result in green it means all test cases are paseed
 

If one of test Case is failed   then it show result in Red like
 


---Steps to generate Emailable report----
1.	Create test class
( which contain @Test Annotation and regular method i.e. test method/test case)
2.	Execute Test class and refresh the project. 
When to run test class then we have to refresh project then project report is automatically created then Test-output folder is created in project.
3.	You will get test-output folder in project.
It contain many file then we have to  click on emailable-report.html

4.	In That folder Right click on the "emailable-report.html" and select the option Open with the web browser or double click on it.
Then we can see report it show all passed test cases fail test cases as time to execute.
If we want to attach with email then we have to copy that file then we have to paste in folder/path then from that folder we can send that report as an attachment to other.
Emailable Report 

	Report generation is very important when you are doing the Automation Testing as well as for Manual Testing.
If we are performing any testing then we have to generate report like automation or manual. By reading that report we can see that test cases which given to is pass or fail and reason of failure.

	By looking at the result, you can easily identify how many test cases are passed, failed and skipped. We can get idea by seeing report how many test cases are pass or fail, skipped.

	By looking at the report, you will come to know what the status of the project is.

	Selenium WebDriver is used for automating the web-application, but it won't generate any reports. Selenium only automate web-base application but if don’t generate any report. For to generate report we use supporting frame work  i.e. TestNG. To generate report we have to integrate TestNG with our project.

	The TestNG will generate the default report.
Execution order in TestNG
Here in TestNG execution order is not done by line by line here execution is done base on testcase name in alphabetical order. We can set priority of them.

Note:
Messages on console and Emailable report 
When we use System.out.println(); its is java’s statement it only responsible to show/print messages on console   But it wont responsible to print on email report.
If run test class then we can check on console it 	show messages but if see on emailable report then on that this message is not shown.
We need this messages on console as well as emailable report also then we have to use
Inbuild class reporter in TestNG  then we have to call this class’s static method log () then we have to send two parameter to this method i.e. 1st parameter message and 2nd parameter Boolean condition i.e. true 
Like 
Reporter.log(“Running TC1”,true); // classname.methodname(“message”,true);
When  we execute this then this method log () print messages on console as well as its also attach with emailable report. here we use Reporter class static method i.e. log () to print messages on console as well as emailable report also.
Now we can see messages on console as well as emailable report also.  

1. if we use sop() to display text as a output then result will be displayed in console not in emailable report.
	2. To display text in emailable report we need to use static method log present in Reporter class.
		eg. Reporter.log("String msg", true)
here if we give 2 parameter is log() i.e. message and true then it show messages on console as well as emailable reports also.(mostly we use this)
but if we 
give 2 parameter i.e. message and false then it don’t show message on console it attach messages to emailable reports only.
Reporter.log("msg", false) or Reporter.log("msg") --> Emailable report

and if we only give 1 parameter input i.e. message in log then also it attach messages on emailable report only.

sop--> Console
Reporter.log("msg", true)---> Console + Emailable Report
Reporter.log("msg", false)/Reporter.log("msg") --> Emailable report

2. TestNG Annotation
	1. @Test
	2. @BeforeMethod
	3. @AfterMethod
	4. @BeforeClass
	5. @AfterClass

1.	@Test:- 
Use for execution of test method/TC.
Marks a method as a test method. TestNG considers methods annotated with @Test for test execution.
It is @Annoation present in TestNG which  used for execution of test method.
Is used for run actual test case.


Precondition which is applicable for each test method which we have to run multiple time depends on how many test method are present in test class. Then we use @beforeMethod and @aftermethod. 
Like supposed we have test case available for to verify the logo so to verify that logo 1st we need to login into web applications then we can verify the logo is present or not.  here we have precondition i.e.  we have to login in to application  then after login we have to execute our test method  then we  have Post condition for to logout from application then we then we mention in after method.
2.	@BeforeMethod:- 
It is use for execution of test method before execution of every test method with an annotation @Test.
@BeforeMethod: Indicates a method that should run before each test method. It is commonly used for setting up preconditions or test data.
When we have precondition available  before to execute test case/ test method then we use @BeforeMethod Annotation.

Like we have precondition to execute test method then we declare that code precondition code in another  method and  like to login into that application then we use @BeforeMethod Annotation like
@BeforeMethod
public void loginToApp()
{
Reporter.log(“login in to App”,true);
}
Here we have actual test case is to verify the logo but before that we have to login into App i.e. precondition we have to run that method before actual test case then we use @BeforeMethod Annotation.
Here 1st it will run @BeforeMethod then it will run @Test method i.e. actual test case.
Execution of class :
When we run this code like we have test case/test method and before method available then it will check that Actual test case is present or not i.e. @Test Method if it present then it will check that is any precondition is present for that test method or not if present i.e. @BeforeMethod is present then it will execute that method first then it will execute actual test method after that.(if precondition is not present then it will ignore that condition). Here test case is only one i.e. which contain @Test Annotation. Other are supporting  methods like if there precondition so run that before method before the test method. 

3.	@AfterMethod:- 
It is use for execution of test method after execution of every test method with an annotation @Test.
: it’s Specifies a method that should run after each test method. It is typically used for cleaning up resources or performing post-test actions.
When we have post condition after executing test case/ test method then we can use @AfterMethod Annotation.

Like suppose we have  postcondition available after executing test method then we write / declare that code in another method and we use @AfterMethod Annotation before that method.
Like 
@AfterMethod 
public void logoutFromApp()
{
Rerporter.log(‘’logout from App”,true};
}
// here like we want run code after executing actual  test case then we use @AfterMethod Annotation.

Execution of this class:
1st  it will @Test Annotation is present or not then it will check that is there any precondition is available before test Method i.e. @BeforeMethod is present or not if it present then it will execute that then it will execute the test method then it will check that is there any post condition available or i.e. @AfterMethod  Annotation is present or not if it present then it will execute that code.
Here actual test case is one but it have precondition and post condition is available.

Some time in one class there are many test case / test script available like we have to 2 -3 test case available in same class then we this @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod Annotation is applicable for all test cases. Here  in one class precondition and postcondition is one which is applicable for all test cases.
In one class we can’t  declare multiple precondition and postcondition. 
Execution flow when we have multiple test method available and we have pre and post condition is available :
 When start execution this class then 1st it will check that how many test method is present in this class like suppose we have 2 @Test Annotation available it means 2 test case is available. so from that 2 test method which execute first then it will check the name of method As we know in TestNG methods are execute in alphabetical order. Then it will check that in alphabetic order then it will check that is there any precondition/ BeforeMethod is available in class or not if present then it will execute that then it will execute that Actual test method then it will check that any postcondition/AfterMethod is available or not if present then it will execute then it will start execution of 2nd test case so before executing that test case again  it will check that @BeforeMthod is present or not if present then it will execute then it will execute the actual test case then it will check that is @AfterMethod is present or not if present then it will execute that code now all then test method are executed and we get report also.
@Before and @AfterMethod is run for Each Test method is present in that class. Suppose we have 5 test method available in same class then this before method and after method will run 5 time. 
We can’t declare different – different before and after method for each test method. this will applicable for all test method available  in class.
Suppose we have condition like we have to 2 test case which required different pre and post condition then we have to run that test method in different test classes.
Precondition which is applicable for each test method which we have to run multiple time depends on how many test method are present in test class. Then we use @beforeMethod and @aftermethod. 


Suppose we have precondition / postcondition which we have to run only one time before executing class execution  and after class execution it don’t consider number method then we have to @Annotation i.e. @BeforeClass and @AfterClass.
Like suppose we have 4-5 test method and before starting execution of this test class we have to run some i.e. we have to open browser and we all test class is executed then we have to run some code i.e. close browser then we use this @BeforeClass and @AfterClass.

Like suppose we have to open browser one time and we have to login every time before executing test method then we have to logout ever time after exeuting test method but we have to just open browser one time when all test method are executed then we have close that browser so in this situation we can use @BeforeClass and @AfterClass Annotation.
4.	@BeforeClass:- 
It is use for execution of test method before execution of test class.
: Identifies a method that should be executed once before any test methods in the class. It is useful for setting up global configurations or initializing shared resources.

When we have to run code before starting execution of test Method only once then we use @BeforeClass Annotation   

When we have multiple test case available and we have to run code before executing  that method then we use @BeforeClass.

Like suppose we want to open browser before executing test method then we write that code in Another method and we use @BeforeClass Annotation before that method like
@BeforeClass
public void openBrowser()
{
Reoporter.log(“opening browser”, true);
}
// when we have to run code before starting execution of test method then we call @BeforeClass Annotation.


5.	@AfterClass:- 
It is use for execution of test method after execution of test class.
: Specifies a method that should be executed once after all the test methods in the class have been executed. It is used for performing cleanup activities or releasing resources.
When we have to run code after execution of class then we use @AfterClass Annotation.
When we have multiple test case available and we have to run code after executing  that method then we use @AfterClass.

Like suppose we have to close the browser after executing all test method then we use wite that code in method and we use @AfterClass Annotation like
@AfterClass
public void closeBroswer()
{
Reporter.log(“closing browser ”,true);
}
//when we have to run code after executing all test method and after test class execution then we use @AfterClass Annotation this will close the browser when all test cases are executed.

Execution :
1st it will check that how many test method are present in class (if @Test / test method is not present only pre and postcondition  available then this code is not work) if the test method is present then it will check is there @BeforeClass Annotation is present if present then it will execute it then if there are two test cases available then it will decide which test method is run first depending on alphabetic order then it will check that is there precondition / @BeforeMethod is present for that method then it will execute that method then it will execute the actual test method then it will check that postcondition /@AfterMethod method is present for that method then it will execute that then start executing 2nd test method again check for @BeforeMethod is present or not if present then it will execute that then execute actual test method and then it will check that post condition is present or no is present it will execute that when all test method is execute and when all class execution is done  then it will check that @AfterClass is present or not if present then it will execute that. 
 (// here browser opening code is run for only one time and then login code /logout code are run for two times then it run browser closing code for one time.)

If we want run precondition each method then we use @BeforeMethod
 if we want run post condition after running each method then we use @AfterMethod (@BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod run depends on test cases like suppose we 5 test methods then it will run 5 times)



Suppose we have multiple test method and before executing that we have to run code then we use @BeforeClass
 and 
if we want run code after executing all test cases then we use @AfterClass
@BeforeClass and @AfterClass run only one time 

@BeforeSuite: 
1.	Marks a method that should run once before all tests in a suite. It is often used for setting up global configurations or initializing common resources.
@AfterSuite: 
2.	Designates a method that should run once after all tests in a suite have been executed. It is typically used for performing final cleanup tasks or generating test reports.
@Parameters: 
3.	Defines parameters for a test method. It allows you to pass values to a test method from an XML file, TestNG configuration, or command line.
@Ignore: 
4.	Skips a test method. When applied, the test method is not executed during test execution.

@Dataprovider
In TestNG, the @DataProvider annotation is used to supply test data to test methods. It allows you to pass different sets of data to the same test method, enabling data-driven testing.
Here's a simple explanation of @DataProvider:
1.	You define a separate method or a data source that provides the test data.
2.	This method or data source is annotated with @DataProvider.
3.	Inside the @Test method, you specify the dataProvider attribute with the name of the data provider method.
4.	TestNG will execute the @Test method multiple times, each time with a different set of data provided by the data provider.
We can create separate class for where we store test data and use @dataprovider method
@Test(dataProvider = "loginData", dataProviderClass = TestData.class)
public void loginTest(String username, String password) {
    // Perform login using the provided username and password
    // ...
}



3. TestNG Keyword:
	1. invocationCount
	2. priority
	3. enabled
	4. TimeOut
	5. dependsOnMethods

1. invocationCount:
	Sometimes same test method/TC need to be executed multiple which can be possible by using TestNG keyword "invocationCount"
		eg. invocationCount=5;
when we want to run particular method multiple time then we can use invocationCount keyword present in TestNG we have to give count with that invocationCount=number how many time we want to execute that test case. So it will run that test case multiple time.
sometime we have to run one test case multiple time because some time if we run that test case one time it will work but if we run that test case multiple time then it don’t work properly to ensue that we have to run that test case multiple time. 
So if we want to run that test method multiple time then we have to call keyword i.e. invocationCount then we have to pass0 number how many time we want to execute that method. Like
@Test(invocationCount=5)
public void tc1()
{
}
// here now this tc1 () test method will run/execute 5 times.
This TestNG keywords are only used with @Test Annotation only. we can’t use this keyword with supporting @Annotation.
We have to use this keyword with test case which we want run for multiple time. Only that method will run multiple time.
2. priority:
	To change test method/TC execution order we need to use TestNG keyword "priority".

.  By default Execution order or test method in TestNG is in alphabetical order. 
Test method whose priority is lowest that test method will execute first.
When we give priority to Test method then it will run test method based on priority it don’t execute alphabetically. It will run lowest priority test method 1st.


		eg. priority=1
Note:  
priority can be  
  1. bydefault=0
If we don’t give priority to method then by default is consider priority 0.
i.e. @Test(priority=0)
like suppose if we give priority to 3 test method and we don’t give priority to 4th test method then 4th test method will execute 1st then after depending on priority it will execute but test case which have lowest priority will execute first and test case which have highest priority will execute next.

2.	+ve integer
Priority can be positive value 
3.	-ve integer
Priority can be navigate (but generally we don’t give priority in negative.
(if priority is -ve then that test method will run first then 0th priority then depending on lowest priority given to test  method ) 
4.	Duplicate
Priority can be dulicate 
we can give duplicate priority also. 
if we don’t give priority to test method then then by default priority is 0. 
When priority is duplicate then execution order is alphabetically.
Suppose we have tc1 and tc2 have duplicate priority i.e. 1 and 1 then tc1 will execute 1st then tc2 will execute. 

       priority can't be  
1.	Decimals
We cant give priority in decimal like 
1.5,1.6 etc.
2. Variables
We can’t  use variable as priority.
Like
int a=5;
@Test (priority =a) like we can’t give priority in variable.






Like suppose we have 3 test method like TC3,TC2 and TC1 then then here TC1 will execute first then TC2 and then TC3 because in TestNG execution of test method is depending on name of test method in Alphabetic order.  By default Execution order or test method in TestNG is in alphabetical order. 
If we want to set execution order of test method based on our requirement then we can make use of priority keyword.
Like suppose if we want run TC3 first then we have to mention priority like
@Test(priority=1)
public void TC3()
{
Reporter.log(“tc3”, true);
}
@Test(priority=2)
public void TC2()
{
Reporter.log(“tc2”, true);
}

@Test(priority=3)
public void TC1()
{
Reporter.log(“tc1”, true);
}

If we want to change execution order of test method then we use priority keyword
Test method whose priority is lowest that test method will execute first.
When we give priority to Test method then it will run test method based on priority it don’t execute alphabetically. It will run lowest priority test method 1st.
If we want to change execution order of test method then we use priority keyword along with @Test Annotation.( some time in report it show wrong order but messages order is same as we executed test method).


3. enabled:
	Disabling a test method/TC in TestNG can be achieved by setting the enabled attribute of the @Test annotation to false.
	eg. enabled=false
we disabled test case execution from test class by using attribute enabled= false keyword.
Suppose we have to three test method and we don’t want to run 3rd test method we want disable that method. 
So in this case we can comment that code  by using // or 
//@Test
//public void Tc3()
//{
//Reporter.log(“Tc3 running ”,true);
//}
Or if we don’t want to run that code then we can call keyword i.e. enabled=false. When execute test method and if we give @Test(enabled=false) then that test method is not execute remaining test method will get executed. Like
@Test(enabled=false)
public void tc3()
{
Reporter.log(“tc3”,ture);
} 
// here as we give enabled=false after @Test means this method is not executed this tc3 () is get disabled this called we disabled test case execution from test class by using attribute enabled= false keyword.
 Some time have too many test cases available in test classes and we don’t want to run particular test method because in that test case have some blocker or we don’t have input available for that method or test data is not available  or development of that test case is incomplete steps which are needed to perform that test cases are incomplete that why we want to disable that test case. Then in this case by using enabled=false we disable that test case.

4.TimeOut:
	If test class contains multiple test methods if one of the test method is time consuming to execute then 
	TestNG bydefault fail that TC & executes the other TC.
	eg. @Test(timeOut=8000)

To Assign time to test method we used timeOut keyword and we have to give time in milliseconds if test method is executed in given time then test method is get passed by TestNG but if test method long time as compared to given time then at that time that test method is get failed by TestNG.
Other wise it throw timeout exception fail that method.
if some time one of test method take long time to execute then at that time we have to stop execution of that method and we have to run method after that. To fail that test case we give specific time to that test case if it complete execution in time then test case is passed but if it taking extra time which we specify then TestNG will automatically fail that test method and stop execution of that method and execute method after that method.

suppose in our test class there are many test methods are present and one of test method is taking too much /extra  time as compared to it’s desired time then we can fail that test case/test method  if it taking extra time to execute by using timeouts keyword and we have to pass second/ time in milliseconds then if test case is passed within given time then that test method will get pass by TestNG and if it taking extra time which is given then TestNG by default fail that test method and execute remaining test methods.


@Test(timeout=6000)
public void TC1()
{
Reporter.log(“Running TC1”,true);
}
// here we assign time to this test method for that we have to use timeout keyword of TestNG then = sign then we have to give time in milliseconds. So for this particular test method 6 sec is given if test method is executed in given time the it will pass if it take extra time then TestNG fail that test method and execute another method if it present in test class.(here this test case have maximum 6 second available to complete test method execution if it take extra time then it will directly failed by TestNG) 
Usually we don’t add timeout mostly but in one of scenarios if test method is taking extra time than expected then we will fail that test method. 
(suppose if we want to fail that test method for that we add wait in that method like )
@Test(timeout=6000)
public void TC1()
{
Therad.sleep(8000);
Reporter.log(“Running TC1”,true);
} 
//here as we added forcefully wait i.e. 8sec and we give 6sec to execute this test method then in this case   so this test method is failed by TestNG and show error message like test method didn’t finish  within time-out 6000 and execute remaining test method.
Here we add wait but  in real time test method is take extra time to  as compared given time to execute at that case test case is get failed by TestNG.

If we mention timeout to test method and if test method is executed in given time then method will get passed and if not complete execution in given time then it will fail that test cases.

In automation we have to run test method within less time because we have many test methods to execute  so it is important that we have to execute test case in given time. If test method taking extra time to execute in any case then that test method is fail by TestNG if we assign timeOut key word to that method.(some time if we give wrong input or wrong condition due this script is stuck at movement so if this condition occurred then we want that script cant wait to long to complete that execution we simply give condition if it executed in given time then it will pass other wise that test method is failed by TestNG and execute remaining test methods.

To Assign time to test method we used timeOut keyword and we have to give time in milliseconds if test method is executed in given time then test method is get passed by TestNG but if test method long time as compared to given time then at that time that test method is get failed by TestNG.

(we calculate time out like if it take time more than if we performing that feature manually that time we will mention in time out depending on observation).(we don’t given timeOut to all test method we only give to test method which are stucking in condition that time we give timeOut) 

 In TestNG we can give multiple keyword to @Test method for that we have to separate them by using (,) commas like @Test(enabled=false,invoactionCount=5,priority=2 ,etc)

5. dependsOnMethods:
	If 1 TC execution depends on multiple TC then we need to use "dependsOnMethods" TestNG keyword.
	eg. dependsOnMethods= {"TC name"}


when we have  test case/ method which is dependent on other test method then we use this keyword i.e. dependsOnMethod and we have to pass test method as string like in double quotes like 
@Test(dependsOnMethod(“testmethodname”)

Like
@Test
Public void login()
{
}
@Test(dependsOnMethod=”login”)
public void lout()
{
}
//here 2nd method is depend on 1st test method if we don’t login then only we can logout but if login method is failed then logout is not possible. Then in this situation we execute 2nd test method if 1st test method is passed.
Here we mention dependency like if test method 1 is passed then only we run 2nd test method for that we use TestNG Keyword i.e. (dependsOnMethod=”Test methodname”)


Working of dependsOnMethod : 
This before executing test method 2nd i.e. which is depend on test method 1 then  depends on method keyword 1st it will execute 1st test method then it will check its result if result is passed then only it run 2nd test method if 1st test method is fail then it will skip 2nd test method i.e. depending method. 

If depended test method is fail then it don’t run the depending test method and it will skip that depending method and it also show error why that 1st or dependent method fail like syntax error or timeOut exception. And it also show the line by which code is fail. i.e. depend on method is not successfully finished method.

Some time one of test case is depending on multiple test cases then like we have 3 test  method are and 3rd test method is depend 1st two test method if both test method are pass then only 3rd test method will execute otherwise if any one method is fail then 3rd test method is not run it is skipped by TestNG.
@Test
Public void tc1()
{
}
@Test
public void tc2()
{
}
@Test
Public void tc3(dependsOnMethod={“Tc1”,”Tc2”})
{
}
// here As 3rd test method is depend on 1st and 2nd method that why we use {} braces and give two or multiple test case name and separate by commas. 
Now this dependsOnMethod before executing 3rd test method it will check that 1st and 2nd test case is passed or fail if both are passed then it will execute 3rd test case otherwise if any one test method is fail then it skipped 3rd test case and show result like 1pass 1fail and 1 skipped.

----------------

Test-Suite: 
	It is xml file which contains all the test classes name which need to be executed.
	It is use to execute all/multiple Test classes.

Test suit is when we have multiple test classes available and we want to run them . 

(then now like we have to run multiple classes one by one means after execution of one class we run another class so we have to wait until each test class is executed and so it will take to much time we run it manually ) so in this case when we want to execute multiple test classes one by one then we run them by using test suite concept.

Test Suit is an XML file which we can run multiple test classes we added all multiple test classes in suite which we want run then we run that suite when we run suite then one by one it will run it will publish combined result of all classes. 
We can run 100 of class at time when all test classes execution is done then it will publish combine result of all classes.

Format of test suite / suite structure 
When we cerate suite then suite will open and  close test open test close then classes open classes close. In that class one in which we provide single class name like. 
<class name=”packageName.className”/> .  //here single class open class close.
 when cerate suite then we provide name like 
<suite name=’Suite Name”>.
Then we provide name to test like 
<test name=”test name”>
</classes> //classes close 
</test > //test close
</suite> // suite close 


When  can add multiple classes in we add that class one by one in classes body like we give packageName.className then we can add multiple classes in suite.

<suite name=”Suite name “>
<test name =”test name”>
<classes >
<class name=”packagename.classname”/>
<class name =packagename.classname/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>


<suite name="Suite name">
  <test  name="Test name">
    <classes>
      <class name="packageName.className"/>
	
    </classes>
  </test> 
</suite>

To create suite we need test classes then we select that test classes then we write click on that selected class then  we have to select classes then we can add classes one by one or directly selecting that classes which we want to added then suite just select them then.
Approach one :
Like we can select one class then we add that class in suite and then one by one we add that class in suite by using packageName.className.
1st we have to select class then we have to right click operation then we see option then we see TestNG then  click on that then we see two option then we have to select convert to TestNG by default test suite name Is  TestNG we can change that also  and file format is .xml  then we have to select finish then in our project we one xml file is created  double click on that then at bottom we see two option i.e.  design and source  we have to click on source then we can see that suite is created we can see code of that suite. Like 
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
<suite name="Suite">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestSuite.Class2"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->
 First two line not consider i.e. <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE suite SYSTEM "https://testng.org/testng-1.0.dtd">
we can change the name of test suite also in classes body one class is added i.e. it contains packagename.classname  i.e. TestSuite.Class2
it is by default created by suite  then we can add another classes also.
and classes can be available in different classes also we can call like i.e. packagename.classname
when we run two/multiple  classes then it will  public combined result.
It show how many test cases run then pass, fail and skip also.
Approach two :
We can add multiple classes in suite
Like while creating suite we can select multiple classes and then we can add that classes in suite.
Select all classes which we want to add in suite then right click then select on TestNG then select covert to TestNG option then we can see that suite is created and we can run that suite and multiple classes are get executed.
We can add 100s of classes.
all packages and classes present in project  we can added into suite 
verification and Assertion 
suppose if we have to identify that given test case is passed or fail for to identify that we have to two inbuild classes available i.e. Assert and SoftAssert by using these classes static and non- static method we can identify that given test case is passed or fail.
For now are verifying by using if else control statement like is the given check box is selected or not if it is selected then we display message pass and if not then It will show message like fail 
Like
Boolean checkbox=driver.findElement(By.xpath(“xpression”));
if(checkbox==true)
{
System.out.println(“checkbox is selected ”);
}
Else
{
System.out.println(“checkbox is not selected”);
}
This called verification by using if else.
But if we use this verification is used to verify expected result of test case then length of test case will increase and test case will take more time to execute.(means whenever we want to perform verification then we have to cerate this code which increase code size and also it will take extra time to execute)
To perform verification we use TestNG in build class i.e. Assert class have static methods  and SoftAssert Class have non-static methods by using this methods we can perform verification.
To reduce length of Test script we need to use of Assert class  static methods or SoftAssert class non-static methods.
Assert Class Static methods :
1.	assertEquals(actual ,expected )
Used to verify if expected result and actual a result if both are same/equal then we get output i.e. pass otherwise fail 
When we have to check actual and expected is result is equal then we use equals(). i.e. Assert.assertEquals(). This method both result equal is both are equal.
then test case is passed otherwise fail.in case of fail TestNG will show reason for fail i.e. expected “message”
But found “othermessage”.
Syntax of  equals()
Assert.assertEquals(actual, expected)

Like we have to verify result like expected and actual result is equal or not 
Like
@Test
public void Tc1()
{
String actResult=”hi”; // this we will get from excel sheet in real time 
String expResult=”hi”;
//here we have requirement like both result are equal then we use assertEquals() of Assert class i.e. is static method so we will call that method in static way.
Assert.assertEquals(); // classname.methodname(actResult,expResult);
}
// here When we run this script if bot expected and actual result is  equal then Test case is passed otherwise fail.
But is actual result and expected result if different then this method will fail that test case and show error like expected  “hi” but found “Hello”(here it expecting hi but actually it get hello so both are not equal so it will fail that test case).
We can add 3rd parameter also like if we want to display message if test case is fail then we can add that messages are but this will only display if test method is fail.  Like
Assert.assertEqulas(actResult,expResult,”Fail: both result are different ”);
This 3rd parameter is run only if test case if fail is test case is passed then it don’t run this code or don’t show any message. It will generate TestNG failure message as well as user generated message also if test case is failed.
if test case is passed then TestNG will directly show Result Pass. In case of fail we have to analyze that why this test case is fail that’s why it shows messages in case of fail.

2.	assertNotEquals(actual, expected)
this method is used verify expected result and actual result if both result are not equal\same then output is pass otherwise fail
if we want expected result and actual result different then we use assertNotEquals() which is static method of Assert class available in TestNG. 
As it is static method then we will call this method in static way  like differentclassNAme.methodName();
Like Assert.assertNotEqulas(); and we have to provide two input i.e. actual result and expected result.  This method only pass the test case if both result are different.  If both  are equal then it will fail that test case. 
This methods are case sensitive means if we give small hi and Capital Hi then it will consider both are different and pass that test case.
Some time we need actual result and expected result different in that case we use assertnotEqulals()
@Test
	public void Tc1()
	{
		String actResult="hi";
		String expResult="hi";
		Assert.assertNotEquals(actResult, expResult);

	}

//Here  as we have different result means Test case is pass but if we excepting both result different but we are getting equal  result in that case test case fail by this assertNotEquals(). Because in this method both results are needed different.

If we give/get both result equal then it assertNotEquals() is fail that test case and show error and reason of failure also like did not expect [hi] but found [hi]
Here also we can add 3rd parameter i.e. user generated message this message is only show when test case is failed 
Assert.assertNotEquals(actResult, expResult,"Fail: Both result are same :");
 
And we get both messages if test case is fail i.e. user generated message also and testNG  failure message also.
Fail: Both result are same : did not expect [hi] but found [hi]
This consider in negative testing means one of the element/  like  there many data present in list and we deleted one them  then also it present there in this case test case is fail.
3.	assertTrue()
used verify condition are true or false if condition is true then output is passed otherwise fail 
when we have condition like we get true value then only test case is passed. This as static method present in assert class and if condition is true then only this method pass the test case otherwise it will fail the test case 
Some time we have Boolean condition like true or false  we have to verify that like elements is present or not or is multiple or not like that when we have Boolean condition to verify then use 
Suppose we have condition like we have to check that radio button is selected means we need true condition then 
@Test
	public void tc1()
	{
		boolean actResult=true;
		Assert.assertTrue(actResult);
	}
Like here we use asserTrue() so as we expecting result true and we get actual result also true then in this condition test case get pass. But if we get actual result false then we get result false.
Like then this method show that test case is fail because expected [true] but found [false] by TestNG.
  We can add user message also if test case is fail like
Assert.assertTrue(actResult,"Fail: condition is false: ");
Here  this this method only pass test case if actual result is true otherwise it fail that test case.

4.	assertFalse()
this method is used to verify condition is true or false if condition is false then output is pass otherwise fail
if we get Boolean condition result is false then that test case is passed. Otherwise it will fail that method. 
like here we are excepting result false and we also get actual result false then this method will pass that test case otherwise fail.

@Test
	public void tc1()
	{
		boolean atcresult=false;
		Assert.assertFalse(atcresult);
	} 
// here we are expecting false and we also get actual result false then test case is passed.
But if we are expecting false and we get actual result true then this method will fail that test case and show error message i.e. expected “false” but found “true”

Here also we add user generated messages also. 
Like
Assert.assertFalse(atcresult,"Fail: expected false but actual result is true :"); 

And this user generated message is only shown if test case is along with system generated messages  like
Fail: expected false but actual result is true : expected [false] but found [true]

Limitations of Assert class
Like suppose if we want to perform multiple verification of one test case. 
When our all verification is passed then it will execute normally. 
But if the 1st verification is fail then verification after that is not execute /check by compiler.
If one of verification is fail then verification after that is not perform by compiler when we use Hard Assertion i.e. Assert class method.
Here next verification is not check by the compiler and if next verification important bug then it is hide if pass then no problem but If next verification is also fail then it is hide if we use Assert class methods.
Like we have to design script like if we have multiple verification then if 1st verification is  get fail then also remaining verification is check or executed. But in assert class if 1st verification is fail then stop execution there remaining verification is not check by assert class method.
If test class is containing multiple test method in one of the test method have multiple verifications are present while executing if one of verification is failed then rest of the verification will not be verified and then TestNG will execute next test method. 
(if test method contain multiple verification if one of verification is fail then remaining verification  will not executed. but if there is only one verification is present then there is no problem to use assert class.)

To overcome the drawback of the assert class we have to use SoftAssert class.
It is class present in TestNG which contains non-static method use to do verification.
Soft assert will do verification if any verification is failed then it will notify and execute the rest of verification. If test method have multiple verification then then one fail then it will notify in console and execute next verification.
SoftAssert Class (verify):
If we want to use softAssert class method then we have to cerate object of softassert class because all methods are non-static method.
Like
SoftAssert as= new SoftAssert();
as.assertEquals(actual, expected); // we call method like objectname.methodname()

All method are same which is present in assert class and working also same but here is one advantage is one of verification is fail then also it execute reaming verification.
 When we are using softassert class method then at the end we have to use asertall() when are using soft assert class method to perform verification then we have to use assertall() method .
Syntax 
softAssertClassObjectName.assertAll();
this assertAll method is used like if one of verification is failed then it will notify in console and execute another verification after one by one if fail again it will shown on console. To notify in console this method is mandatory. 
When we have multiple verification for one test case then we use soft Assert class over the assert class for that we have to cerate object of soft assert class non-static method. and we have to call assertAll() to show messages/notify  on console otherwise if we don’t call this method then it will publish wrong result.
There are two type of assert 1st hard assert when we use assert class static method is called hard assert and 2nd soft assert when we use SoftAssert class non-static method is called soft assert.
Difference between soft assert and hard assert 
Hard assert	Soft assert
1.	when we use hard assert i.e. if we use assert class static method suppose on of test case have multiple verification is present then if 1st verification is fail then it don’t check next verification.	But in soft assert suppose on of test case have multiple verification is present then if one of the verification is failed then it notify on console and check/execute next verification .

Verification/Assertion
1. hard assert (Assert class)  -->static method
2. Soft assert (SoftAssert class) --> non-static method

--------------------
Disable Test Case/ test method  Execution from test class and test suite 
We can disable test case / test method using two way 

1.	we can disable test case/ method from Test class using 'enabled=false' keyword

like we already know that we can disable test metho by using enabled= false parameter 
like 
@Test(enabled =false)
public void m1()
{
Reporter.log(“running m1”,true);
}
Like suppose we have 4 test cases available in test class and we only want to execute three of them then we can disabled that test method which we want to disable / we don’t want to run that method then we can TestNG keyword i.e. enabled =false parameter along with @Test Annotation. i.e. @Test (enabled=false) then that test case is not executed it is disable for now. This method execution is disabled. Now all test method are get executed exclude this method because this test method is disable.
If we want to disable on of method in test class then we use keyword along with @Test Annotation like. @Test (enabled=false).
 

2.	we can disable test case / method from Test suite by using
include keyword or exclude key word. 
We can disable test method by using test suite also by using include or exclude keywords 
A.	include keyword
we can disable test method by using include keyword like 
first we have to create suite by selecting classes which we want to run.

Normal test suit 
<suite name="Suite">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestSuite.Class2"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->


In suite it contains suite, suite name, test, test name, classes and in which different class which we want to run class open and class close in between class body then open methods keyword  because in classes there are class available and in class there are methods available that why methods open and close .  we have to run some particular methods then we have to call include keyword in test suite like <include name=”login”/> only this login method is run as we used include. And other methods are disable by suite.
Means it only run login test method and other test method are disabled.
By using include keyword we are disable some test methods in test suite.
In include only method which are given in include body only that methods are executed.

Test Suite with methods and include keyword.
<suite name="Suite">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestSuite.Class2">
      <methods>
     <include name="login"/>
      </methods>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->



B.	exclude keyword
disable test case execution by using exclude keyword  
by using exclude keyword also we can disable method which we want to disable.
By using exclude we can mention test method name which we want exclude means we don’t want to run that method or we can simply disable that method. for that we have use exclude keyword. like
<suite name =”suitename”>
<test name=”testname”>
<classes>
<class>
<methods>
<exclude name=”methodname”/>
<methods/>
<class/>
<classes/>
<test/>
<suite/>
<suite name="Suite">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestSuite.Class2">
      <methods>
      <exclude name="login"/>
      </methods>
      </class>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->

Here also we open class then we close that class then in between we open methods then we close method and in methods body we open keyword and mention test method name which we want to exclude then we give that test method name then that method is excluded i.e. disable all method present in that class is executed except method which mention in exclude.
like when we run this suite then all methods are run in class2 exclude “login” test method this login() method is disabled by using exclude keyword.
like suppose we have condition like we have 10 test case and we want to run 9 test case we want to disable 10th test method disable then we use exclude keyword in test suite file and we give name of that method then that method will not execute i.e. 10th test method is disabled.

Include 	Exclude 
In include only method which we mention in include only that methods are executed other methods are disabled / that method is not executed.	In exclude all test cases are get executed only method which we mention in exclude onlythat method is disabled or not executed.


How to disable test case execution ?
So there are two way first we can disable test method execution by using  in test class (enabled =false) parameter.
Also we can disable test method/case execution from test suite by using include and exclude keyword/ parameter.

We can’t use include and exclude keyword combined in one test suite. In any case we cant use include and exclude for same class. because our scenario is work by using any one keyword either include or exclude.
----------------

Failed.xml

While executing test automation scripts, test cases may fail for several reason to optimize our next runs we need to re-run only failed test cases.
Like suppose we have 10 test cases and run all test case and in that run 8 test method are passed and two fail when this two test cases are fail then we analyse that test method why that test cases are fail 
Like test case can may fail due 
1.	environment issue – 
like network issue , page not loading, black screen problem, screen freeze etc.
2.	script error 
like if we give wrong conditions, or locator is change 
3.	actual bug is present 
due this reasons due to which script may fail.
If script is fail then we analyse that if there is environment issue then once again we can re run that script   or if there is script error then we will fix that error, if locator/element  is messing we can give new xpath for that.
If there is bug then we will rerun that methods which is fail we will rerun that method in second round.
Suppose 1st time we run 10 test method in 1st round 8 test method are passed then there is no need to re-run that pass test method again in 2nd round we only run failed test method after fix issue like code change and  all.
If suppose in 2nd round also if one test method is fail then we again fix that method and again only run that failed method in next run.
If we want re-run only failed test cases/ method then TestNG provide xml file which contain only failed test cases. i.e. failed xml file 
Here in first round of execution we run 100 test cases then some test cases may passed and some may get fail then we will maintain result of pass test cases in excel sheet and  test cases which are failed then we have to analysis that failed test cases why this are failed what is reason behind that we will find it out.
 After fixing then we will run only failed test cases in 2nd round of executions. To re-run this failed test cases TestNG provide xml file i.e. testng-failed.xml file which only contain test cases which are failed in last run. (test cases which are passed that test cases are not added in failed.xml file.) by using this failed.xml file we can execute test case which are failed in last run.
how to execute fail test cases?
By using failed.xml file we can run failed test cases.

While executing the automation scripts, test cases may fail for several reasons. 
To optimize our next runs,
we need to re-run only failed test cases

Reasons for fail TC
1. Envirnment issue
2. Script error
3. Bug

Steps to execute failed.xml file
How cerate failed.xml file 
1.	1st we have Create test suite file under project folder.
For that we have to select and   added some classes in test suite then 

2.	execute test suite file
when run test suite then we get report of passed and failed result how many test cases are pass and how many of them are failed.
If test cases are failed then it also show to reason of failure also.
Suppose if one the test case failed due to script error then we will fix that test case. When run test case then we get xml file who many pass and fail if there are failed test cases then we will fix that test cases if there script error after 1st round of execution. And we maintain this records in excel also we mark all pass and fail test case then we fix fail test case.


( but is test case is failed due to bug then we can’t do ay thing.)
Now after fixing we want to run failed test case of last run then we will refresh the project
3.	Refresh the project

After refreshing project 

4.	In the test-output folder >> testng-failed. xml file will be created.
Then in test out folder testing-failed.xml file is created.
This suite Is by default created by TestNG. Which only include failed test case of all classes which are failed in last execution.
5.	execute "testng-failed. xml"
by using this testing-failed.xml file we can run only failed test cases.
In this way we can execute fail testcases in TestNG class.
testng-failed.xml
<suite name="Failed suite [Suite]" guice-stage="DEVELOPMENT">
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test(failed)">
    <classes>
      <class name="TestSuite.Class2">
        <methods>
          <include name="logout"/>
        </methods>
      </class> <!-- TestSuite.Class2 -->
      <class name="TestSuite.Class1">
        <methods>
          <include name="TC7"/>
          <include name="TC6"/>
        </methods>
      </class> <!-- TestSuite.Class1 -->
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test(failed) -->
</suite> <!-- Failed suite [Suite] -->
When run this suite then test case are run now again one test case is passe then we will update this in excel that test case which is failed in 1st round of execution is passed in 2nd round of execution.
If there is bug then we will remain is at it is and we raise it as defect.
 When refresh after executing failed.xml then it automatically update and test method which is passed is removed from this testing-failed.xml file and it only contain last execution /run failed test cases.
This testng-failed.xml file is only one time this file is  created and after every round of execution it get updated and it only contain failed test cases of last execution round are added in this testng-failed.xml suite. This failed test cases are added by TestNG.

Groping of test cases:
Suppose in test classes are contains test methods available of one module or multiple modules like login, profile and setting.
There is possibility that in one test class which contains test cases of multiple modules.
@Test 
Public void Tc1 ()
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 1 ”,true);
}
@Test 
Public void Tc2 ()
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 2 ”,true);
}
@Test 
Public void Tc3 ()
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 3 ”,true);
}


If in test class if there is test cases present for different modules then we can identify them by using  (groups=”modulename”) i.e. we have to use @Test (groups=”modulename) by doing this we can identify this test case is belongs to login module.by using groups we can identify which test method belongs to which module.
@Test (groups=”login”) // this Tc1 is belong to login module
Public void Tc1 ()
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 1 ”,true);
}
@Test (groups=”login) 
Public void Tc2 ()// Tc2 test method belongs to login module
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 2”,true);
}
@Test (groups=”profile”)
Public void Tc3()//Tc3 belongs to profile module 
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 3 ”,true);
}

@Test (groups=”setting”)
Public void Tc4 ()
{
Reporter.log(“running test case 4 ”,true);
}
// here in test class we have 4 test cases available 2 belongs to login module and 1 belongs to profile and one belongs to setting. Here class contains test cases of 3 different module.
 Like in second test class also it contains test method of same module or it may contains test case of different module. 
Like in 2nd test class it contain test case for login module i.e. 1 test case is available and profile module i.e. 2 test cases and 3rd module is setting i.e. 1 test cases 
Now we want to run all test case at same time so we add both test class in  in test suite now  this test class are run one by one and all i.e. 8 test method will get execute. 
But some time we have condition like we want to run only login module related test case from both test classes. So here in test class 1 it contains 2 test method and in a class 1 it contains 1 test case for login module. 
So in this case we can apply filter in test suite when we run test suite then all classes which are going to get run then from all test classes only test method which are belongs to login page/ particular module/ particular group  test method only run. 
Include keyword in grouping 
So to do that we have to apply filter before classes open i.e. groups open and close in body of groups we have to use run open and close in body of run we can use include or exclude keyword depending on our condition. If we use include then method which we mention in include that groups method only run from all test class present in suite or if we use exclude then groups which we mention in exclude except that all groups test method will execute. 
Like
<suite name = ”Suite” >
<test name=”Test”>
<groups>
<run>
<include name=”login”/>
</run>
</groups>
<classes>
<class name=”pacakgename.class1>
<class name=”packageame.class2”>
</class>
</classes>
‘’’’’’’’
// here as we mention include then only test cases which belongs to login module is going to get executed from classes present in suite.
Now it will apply filter then it only run login module related test cases from classes present in test suite. 
When we run test class then as class1 consist of 2 test method of login and 2nd class contains 1 test method of login only this method will run from test class which is present in test suite.
Like we want to run test case of 2 modules from test classes present suite then we have to class include keyword 2 times.
Like

<include name=”login”/>
<include name=’profile”/>
// here we apply filter when we execute test suite then test cases which belongs to login and profile module only that test cases are going to run. From class present in suite.
Like in class1 2 test case are related to login and 1 test case is related to profile page and in class2 2 test case are belongs to profile and 1 test case is belongs to login this method are only run from both test classes.
Exclude keyword in grouping 
We can use exclude keyword also if we have a condition like don’t want run test cases related to login module then we use exclude. 
Like 
<groups>
<run>
<exclude name=”login”/>
</run>
</groups>
<classes>
</classes>
// as we apply filter when run this test suite then all test method are run from classes present in test suite only login module test cases are not get executed.

Parallel execution  
Like suppose we two test classes in 1st test class it open browser then it will open Flipkart URL then it will wait for 5 sec then it will close that browser and in second test class also we are opining browser and after that we are opening Facebook URL then wait for 5 sec then it will close that browser.
When we add this two classes in test suite then test suite then this 2 test class are get executed one by one it will execute 1 test class it open browser then open Flipkart site then wait for 5sec and it will close that browser after execution of 1st test class then it will start execution of 2nd test class. 
Here class will run one by one. 
(Like suppose we have 2 test classes and to execute one test class it need 1 hr and two execute 2nd test class it need 1 hr but we have situation we have to run both class in 1hr then it not possible because when we execute test suite then it will execute test classes one by one means after completing execution of one class it will execute next test class.
In this situation if we want result in 1 or 1 hr 15 min then it not possible for now because only one class is taking 1hr to execute then it will not possible. )
Then in this situation we run both classes parallelly means we can start execution of both class at same time As we start execution of both classes same time then we get result in less time.
(when we start execution of both classes at same time then we get result in less time i.e. within 1hr in case of our example)
we can perform parallel execution in Two ways
1st we run class present in test at same time. When we want to run classes present in one test parallelly then we have to add one parameter with test i.e. parallel = “classes” 
Like
1st approach parallel execution using parallel=”classes” 
when we want run all classes present in one test parallelly then we can use parallel =”classes” parameter.
<test name =”Test” parallel=” classes”>
When we add this parallel=”classes” parameter  with test  then all the classes present in test will execute parallelly means classes are  execution starts at same time.  
Like 
<test name=”Test” parallel=”classes”>
<classes>
<class name =”packagename.class1”/>
<class name=”pacakage.class2”/>
</classes>
// as here we mention parallel =”classes “ with test then call then classes present in test then execution of all this classes will start parallelly. i.e. at same time there execution will starts.
 (some time it will take small time to open one site because all web site have different load time.)

 2nd approach Parallel  execution with parallel=”tests” parameter 
2nd approach if in one of suit there are multiple test available then we can run multiple test parallel.

Sometime multiple classes are present in one test like
<test name=”Test”>
<classes>
<class name=”package1.class1”/.>
<class name=”package.class2/>
</classes>
 But some time in suite it can contain multiple test also present.( like in one project multiple packages are present)  like that in one suite multiple test may present.
Like 
<suite name=”Suite”>
<test name=”Test1”>
<classes>
<class name=”pacakge1.class1”/>
</classes>
</test >
<test name=”Test2”>
<classes>
<class name=”package1.class2”/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
// in this suite 2 test are available and both test contains 1-1 class when we run this suite then test 1 will execute 1st after when execution of class 1 is completed then test 2 will execute. 
One by one both classes will get execute. 

 But we have situation like we have to run this test1 and test2 at same time/parallelly  then we have to call parameter i.e. parallel =”tests” with suite  to run multiple tests present in suite we have to call tests parameter. When we add this parameter with suite then all tests present in suite will run parallelly.
Like 
<suite name =”Suite” parallel=”tests”>
<test name=”Test1”>
<classes>
<class name=”package1.class1”/>
</classes>
</test>
<test name=”test2”>
<classes>
<class name =”package.class2”/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
// As here this suite contains 2 tests available and we mentioned parallel=”tests” with suite then both tests execution will start parallelly. 
Difference between parallel =”classes” and parallel =”tests”.
parallel =”classes”	parallel =”tests”.

When we have multiple classes present in test and we want run all classes parallelly then we use parallel=”classes” parameter .	When we multiple test present in suite and we want run multiple test at same time then we can parallel =”tests” parameter.
We mention this parallel =”classes” parameter in test like
<test name=”Test” parallel=”classes>	We mention this parallel=”tests” parameter in suite.
Like
<suite name=”Suite” parallel=”tests”>



Compatibility testing /muti browser testing :
 Compatibility testing means using same code to perform action different- different browser.
Muti browser testing means we run/execution of  same code on different- different browser.
While performing multi browser testing we design code we run that code on  multiple browser and we decide execution of code means on which browser this code will run by using test suite.
Like if in suite if we mention chrome then that chrome goes to test class then in that class it will execute code code on chrome. If we mention Firefox then this fireforx goes in test class and it will executecode on firefox. 
For suite we can send parameter or input in test class. like from suite we are sending browser name to test class then it will perform comparison operation like which browser has to open or on which browser this code will execute. 
So we control script from test suite. Then browser name is goes to test class then it will perform comparison operation then it will open  particular browser. 
Like 
@Test 
Public void openBrowser
{

}
Like here we send browser name from test suite  to test class then that browser name  browser will open. 
Like first we have to add test class in suite.
Now suite create like
<suite name=”Suite”>
<test name=”test”>
<classes>
<class name=”packagename.classname”/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
//Like we have to send browser name from test suite to test class (like we can fetch data from excel sheet we send information for test suite to test class.)
Parameter in test suite
Like we have to create  parameter for information which we want to send in test class.  we have test after that we have classes then we can send parameter to classes so that we have to create parameter by using parameter keyword  after test and before classes like 
<suite name=”Suite”>
<test name=”test”>
<parameter name=”Browser_name” value=”chrome”>
<classes>
<class name=”packagename.classname”/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
// here we create parameter before classes which have name and value i.e. in name we give name of parameter i.e. Browser_name which want and in value we give value like browser like chrome, firefox etc. i.e. chrome (like we declare variable that same way we declare parameter like studname=Rahul  name is variable and Rahul is value/information  of that variable ) so here browser_name is parameter name  i.e. variable and value is chrome.
Now we can send this parameter to test suite. So to accept this parameter in test suite we have to call @paramater Annotation before @Test annotation.  Then we have to mention the name to parameter after @parameter Annotation like @parameter (“Broswer_name”).
 @parameter accept parameter from test suite we have to give name of parameter in () which accept string like then we have to give name of parameter in double quote. Like @parameter(“Browser_name”) name of parameter can be any thing and value is actual name of browser like edge, firefox, etc. Name which is given test suite that name will accept in @paramter. 
i.e. @paramtere(“Browser_name”)
@Test
Parameter which is created in suite that parameter we will accept in test class by using @paramter Annotation. And in bracket of annotation we mention the name of parameter i.e. Browser_name. Now we send this parameter to test case.
Like 
@parameter(“browser_name)
@Test
Public void openBrowser(String Browser_name)
{
}
Comparison 
// parameter which is come from test suite that parameter we send to test case.
Like the parameter which we cerateed in suite that parameter is accepted in test class by using @parameter Annotation then in bracket of () we provides name of parameter then that parameter name is sends to of test method. then actual test case we perform comparison operation like
@parameter (“Browser_name)
@Test
public void openBrowser(String Browser_name)
{
if(Browser_name.equals(“chrome”) // browser name coming from test suite if it is chrome then it will enter in if body and execute code to run code on chrome browser/ it will open chrome browser. 
{
ChromeDrive driver=new ChromeDriver();
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“firefox”) // if browser name is not chrome then it will check with else if it  firefox or not  then it firefox  it will open firefox
{ 
FirefoxDriver driver= new FirefoxDriver(); // like this we can setup for each browser. Like browsernameDrive.
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“edge”) // browser name is not match with chrome and firefox then it will check that browser_name is edge or not if its edge then it will open edge browser.
{
EdgeDriver driver=new EdgeDriver();
}
} 
//so this code will perform comparison like which browser have to open. Like name coming from suite according to that it will open that particular browser. Like suppose if we mention chrome in value then that chrome will come in @parameter (Broswer_name) in Browser_name as we send this Broswer_name to method then it come to method then it will enter in test method and then it will perform comparison operation. As chrome is matching with if then it will enter in if body it will execute code and then it will chrome. As 1st condition true then it don’t check reaming condition. 
Now this chrome is store in driver. 
Now we want open URL then call code 
Like
driver.get(“”); 
// here we don’t get access of method because scope of driver is only limited to that method because that object are local.
So we have to declare it globally as we have to declare 3 driver
Like 
ChromeDrive drive;
FirefoxDriver driver;
EdgeDriver driver;
like we cant declare  multiple object with same name globally. We can’t use same object name for different browser i.e. datatype. 
So we will perform upcasting like we carte object of subclass with reference to supper class. like
We carte object of chromeDriver and provide reference of WebDriver. This called as upcasting.  Like same 
@parameter (“Browser_name)
@Test
public void openBrowser(String Browser_name)
{
if(Browser_name.equals(“chrome”) // browser name coming from test suite if it is chrome then it will enter in if body and execute code to run code on chrome browser/ it will open chrome browser. 
{
WebDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();//We carte object of chromeDriver and provide reference of WebDriver
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“firefox”) // if browser name is not chrome then it will check with else if it  firefox or not  then it firefox  it will open firefox
{ 
WebDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver(); We carte object of FirefoxDriver and provide reference of WebDriver
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“edge”) // browser name is not match with chrome and firefox then it will check that browser_name is edge or not if its edge then it will open edge browser.
{
WebDriver driver =new EdgeDriver();//We carte object of EdgeDriver and provide reference of WebDriver
}
} 
Upcasting 
So we will perform upcasting like we carte object of subclass with reference to supper class. like
We carte object of chromeDriver and provide reference of WebDriver. This called as upcasting.  Advantage is globally we create only one object 
i.e.
WebDriver driver;
And we assign value to driver in if else condition. Because at time all condition is true in else if. Like 
If we send chrome from suite then it will comes to @paramter (Browser_name) then as we send this parameter to test method then this will goes into method and perform comparison operation i.e. if(Browser_name.equals(“chrome”)) here condtition is true then it will execute the code to open chrome browser then it will assign ChromeDriver to driver i.e. global object of WebDriver. 
@parameter (“Browser_name)
@Test
public void openBrowser(String Browser_name)
{
WebDriver driver = nulll;
if(Browser_name.equals(“chrome”) // browser name coming from test suite if it is chrome then it will enter in if body and execute code to run code on chrome browser/ it will open chrome browser. 
{
driver=new ChromeDriver();
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“firefox”) // if browser name is not chrome then it will check with else if it  firefox or not  then it firefox  it will open firefox
{ 
driver= new FirefoxDriver(); // like this we can setup for each browser. Like browsernameDrive.
}
else if(Browser_name.equals(“edge”) // browser name is not match with chrome and firefox then it will check that browser_name is edge or not if its edge then it will open edge browser.
{
driver=new EdgeDriver();
}
driver.get(“https://www.facebook.com/”);
driver.manage().window().maximize();
Thred.sleep(2000);
Driver.close();
} 
//
So here we will perform upcasting like we carte object of subclass with reference to supper class. like
We carte object of chromeDriver and provide reference of WebDriver. This called as upcasting.  Advantage is globally we create only one object 
i.e.
WebDriver driver;
And we assign value to driver in if else condition. Because at time all condition is true in else if. Like 
If we send chrome from suite then it will comes to @paramter (Browser_name) then as we send this parameter to test method then this will goes into method and perform comparison operation i.e. if(Browser_name.equals(“chrome”)) here condtition is true then it will execute the code to open chrome browser then it will assign ChromeDriver to driver i.e. global object of WebDriver. 
Now it will open browser (it don’t check other condition if one of condition is true )and it execute code after if else 
Like
driver.get(“ https://www.facebook.com/”);
when we declare object globally then for now it don’t have any value initially we have to give null to  global object value.
i.e. 
WebDriver driver=null;
It get value after performing comparison operation. It will perform comparison then which condtion is match then it will open that browser and store that value in driver. Once the value is assign to driver then we can perform operation on that browser. 
Like we create code after if else so this code will work on every browser. Code after if else will run on each browser which send from test suite. 
Like if we send chrome then that chrome then it goes to @parameter then that goes to test method then initially driver have null value then in if it will Broswer_name have to chrome or not if it match then it will execute that code in if body i.e. then it execute right parameter i.e. new ChromeDriver(); then it will open chrome browser assign it driver. Then it will exit from if else then execute code in chrome browser.
In a same way if we mention firefox the that firefox comes open firefox after comparing if codntion is true then it open firefox and it assign to driver then it exit from if else and execute code on firefox. 
Like same way if we pass edge then it will open edge then it assign edge to driver then it exit from if else and run code on edge browser. 

If we are using selenium old version i.e. 4.5.3 then we have to use system.setProperty and we have to set path of each browser driver and we have to download all browser driver. But if we are using selenium 4.6.0 then we don’t need to set path or download any driver. 
When we run suite then it will open browser which is pass from test suite i.e. chrome.
For to open firefox we have to download gecko driver. Then we have to set path for it.
Suppose if we want to run same code on multiple browser then we have to cerate two test 
Compatibility testing 
<suite name=”Suite” >
<test name =”Test1”>
<parameter name=”Broswer_name” value=”chrome”/>
<classes>
<class name=”package.class” />
</classes>
</test>
<test name=”test2”>
<parameter name=”Broswer_name”  value=”firefox”/>
<classes>
<class name=”package.class”/>
</classes>
</test>
</suite>
(// test which is run is not decide on test name but is decide on value of parameter means this test will run on which browser  depending on value of parameter it will open that browser like. value is chrome then it will open chrome. If value is firefox then it will open firefox.)
When run this suite then same code will execute on multiple browser i.e. here first given class code is executed on chrome and then it will run same code on firefox when we run suite then it will execute line by line. 
Compatibility testing  means same code will execute on different browser. 
If we have 1000 line code then also that same code will run on different- different  browser. 
To perform compatibility testing 1st we have create suite then in that suite after test we have to cerate parameter in suite which we have to give name and value and that same parameter we will send in Test class by using @parameter Annotation in bracket( we have to give string parameter name ) then this parameter is pass to test method as an input then in test method it will perform comparison then at time it will open one browser and then it will execute code in that particular browser. 
So our code will run on any browser.
We have to add class in test suite before creating code in test class then class name is added in suite but if we create suite after adding code then class name is not created in test suite we have to cerate it manually.  And then we have to add parameter before classes..
Like
<parameter name= “Browser_name” value=”chrome”/>
<classes>
<class name=package.class/>
</classes>

We can run same code in multiple browser just we have to cerate test for each browser.  After executing code on multiple browser it will publish result combinedly. 
In compatibility testing in framework we have to call @parameter annotation before the @beforeclass annotation like
@parameter (“Browser_name”)
@BeforeClass()
Public void login(String BroswerName)
{
}
compatibility testing with parallel execution .
Like suppose we want to run multiple browser parallelly then we have to mention parallel= “test” like we can run all tests parallelly. 
When we add parallel= “tests” then it is called compatibility testing with parallel execution.
And when we remove parallel=”tests” then it is called compatibility testing.
Then we have to  create parallel = “test” in suite .
<suite name=”suite” parallel=”tests”>
When we run then tests will run parallel.


TestNG advantages
Why you add TestNG  in in Your project?
 It has different assertions that helps in checking the expected and actual results.
By using different assertion we can check actual result and expected result.
 It allows to assign priority to test methods
We can assign / set priority.
 It allows to define dependency of one test method over other method
We can assign dependency on methods
 It provide Detailed (HTML) reports/ Emailable report
We can get Emailable report.
 It allows grouping of test methods into test class
We can run groups of method in different test classes.
 TestNG provides parallel execution of test methods
We can run perform parallel execution of classes.
 TestNG provides multi browser/CT testing of test methods
We can perform compatibility testing 
 It has diff Annotations
It contains many annotation by using we can add precondition and post condition.
 By using  Test Suite we can run multiple tests at same time.

TestNG previous version is Junit. 
Difference of Junit and TestNG 
	Junit	TestNG
Parallel Execution 	Junit dose not support parallel execution.	TestNG  can run Parallel execution. TestNG supports parallel execution 
Dependency of Test method 	Junit does not support Dependency of test method./ The dependency tests are missing in Junit	Dependency tests are present in TestNG / TestNG support Dependency of test method.
 Grouping of test method 	Grouping of test cases are not possible in Junit / Grouping tests together is not possible in Junit 	Grouping of test cases are not possible in Junit. Test can be grouped and run parallel.
Support Annotation 	 Junit does not support advanced annotation.	It supports advanced annotation.

Like Advanced annotation like 
@beforesuite – before running complete suite we have to run some code then we use @beforesuite 
@AfterSuite – after running complete test suite we have to run some code then we use @aftersuite.

@BeforeTest -suppose we want to run some code before running each test in test suite then we call @Beforesuite 
@AfterTest. – Suppose we want to run some code after running each test then we call @AfterTest. 
This annotation is supported in TestNG but not supported in Junit.



Integration of POM DDF With TestNG:
(here we are using previously used POM DDF code in new package and According TestNG and our Framework we make changes in that. Like in POM classes and Test Class also.)
Now we covert POM DDF with TestNG then we have to perform modification in POM Class.
Now we have to create test class by using different Annotation of TestNG.
Like first we cerate dummy code first for all steps present in test case.
1st  we have create Test method by using @Test Annotation 
Like
@Test
public void verifyLogo()
{
}
Now to verify logo first we have to login in Application i.e. precondition for that  we have to cerate method  which contain code for login by using @BeforeMethod Annotation. Like 
 @BeforeMethod
Public void loginToApplication()
{
}
Now after executing actual test case if we have some post conditions then we have to use @AfterMethod Annotation. Like after verifying logo we have to logout from Application so we create logout related code in @AfterMethod like
Like
@AfterMethod
Public void logoutFromApp()
{
}
Like suppose in particular test class contains 2-3 test method then before executing that test method it will login into application then execute that test method then it will logout from application this @BeforeMethod and @AfterMethod is applicable for all test method is present in that particular  test class.
But initially we have to open browser once and at the end means when all test cases are executing then we have to close that browser means we have to run code before the test class execution and also after test class execution for that we have to use @BeforeClass and @AfterClass Annotation like
@BeforeClass
public void openBrowser()
{
}
This @BeforeClass method run before execution of test class only once.
@AfterClass
Public void clsoeBrowser()
{
}
This @AfterClass method after test class execution only once.
(here browser open only once before execution test class once browser open then it will execute test method before that it will execute @BeforeMethod after that Actual  test method then it will execute @AfterMethod and if there is another test method then it will execute in same way after executing all test method it will execute @AfterClass method and close browser.
Now in before class we create code which we have to perform only once like browser open, objective creation, sheet load  of multiple POM classes so this type of code we will create in @BeforeClass Method i.e. by using @BeforClass Annotation. 
(we declare that code in Test class)

	@BeforeClass
	public void OpenBrowser() throws EncryptedDocumentException, IOException
	{
		FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream("F:\\Excel\\Book1.xlsx");
		Sheet sh = WorkbookFactory.create(file).getSheet("Sheet5");
		 System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "D:\\selenium\\chromedriver.exe");
		 WebDriver m= new ChromeDriver();
		 m.manage().window().maximize();
		 m.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
		 
		 m.get("https://www.saucedemo.com/");
		 
	 	swagLabLoginPage login= new swagLabLoginPage(m);

		 swagLabHomePage home= new swagLabHomePage(m);

		 SwagLabOpneMenuPage menu= new SwagLabOpneMenuPage(m);
	}
//here in @BerforeClass Annotation we add code like to load excel sheet, browser open and implicitly wait and we cerate object of all POM classes i.e. login page, home page and open menu page.(here we load sheet then we open browser and hit URL then we create object of all pom classes.)

Then in @BeforeMethod Annotation method we will cerate code for to login application.(like to perform login first we enter user name and then password then we hit login button.) for that we have to class loginpageObjectName.MethodName we call that method and we can add username and password then we can hit login button.
login.
By doing this we can get access of login page methods because we create object in method so scope of that object is limited to that method only.(like variable are local and global like that same way object are also local and Global). Like it is local object so out side method we can’t access it. so to use that variable/ object throughout class then we have to declare that variable/ object globally and we have to initialize that object or variable in method i.e. we declare object/ variable Globally and we provide value locally i.e. within method. while initializing local we just use name of variable or object 
Like 
int a; // declare globally 
public void m1()
{
a=15; // initialize locally 
syso(a);
}
// variable is available globally we jut provide value inside method i.e. locally. Now can call this variable throughout class. in any methods. Like 
Same way we have to declare object Globally and we provide value locally 
Like we have to give datatype and object name only globally  then while providing value we just have to call object name = value we can provide value locally. 

And we have to cerate object of WebDriver globally then we can call its method in throughout class. and we provide value locally 
Then we have to declare sheet Globally because we have to fetch data from sheet and sheet scope also limited to that method for that we have to declare it globally and initialize locally. 
When we call sheetObjectname then we can fetch the data stored in that sheet throughout class.
When we declare globally and provide value locally then we can use it throughout class.
int a;// declare globally 
	
	Sheet sh;
	WebDriver m;
	swagLabLoginPage login; // datatype objectname
	swagLabHomePage home;
	SwagLabOpneMenuPage menu;
	@BeforeClass
	public void OpenBrowser() throws EncryptedDocumentException, IOException
	{
		FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream("F:\\Excel\\Book1.xlsx");
			sh = WorkbookFactory.create(file).getSheet("Sheet5");
		 System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "D:\\selenium\\chromedriver.exe");
		 m= new ChromeDriver();
		 m.manage().window().maximize();
		 m.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
		 
		 m.get("https://www.saucedemo.com/");
		 
		 login= new swagLabLoginPage(m);
		home= new swagLabHomePage(m);
		 menu= new SwagLabOpneMenuPage(m);
		 a=15;
		 
	}
	@BeforeMethod
	public void logininApp()
	{
		login.inpswagLabLoginPageUsername(sh.getRow(0).getCell(0).getStringCellValue());
		login.inpswagLabLoginPagepassword(sh.getRow(0).getCell(1).getStringCellValue());
		login.clickswagLabLoginPageLoginbutton();
	}
	@Test
	public void verifylogo()
	{
		home.verifyswagLabHomePageLogo();
		
	}
	
	@AfterMethod
	public void logoutfromApp()
	{
		home.clickswagLabHomePageOpenmenu();
		menu.clickswagLabMenuPageLogoutbutn();
		
	}
	
	@AfterClass
	public void closeBrowser()
	{
		m.close();
	}
//now this code is converted in to Annotation.
We can add wait also.

We can directly open browser and login application  in @BeforeClass then in we can add test cases in @Test annotation directly then in @AfterClass we can close browser.
Verification using Assert or soft Assert method 

(now we are preforming verification from POM class but now we don’t  perform verification in test class )but From Now we for verification we have to Assert class or Soft Assert class method for verification in Test class. Assert class and soft assert class methods are only used in Test class in POM classes we can’t call that methods.
Like previous we are using code for to perform verification in POM class. like
public void verifyswagLabHomePageLogo() 
	{
		boolean result = logo.isDisplayed();
		if(sd==true)
		{
			System.out.println("logo is present");
		}
		else
		{
			System.out.println("logo is not present");
		}
		
	}
But from now we only return result like true or false value which is stored in object we just return that value i.e. result  to test class and by using assert class method assertTrue() or assertfalse() we can verify test case is passed or fail.
From now we don’t use above approach like we don’t use if else for verification. Instead of this we cerate method  by using this method we are getting result like the logo is present or not for that we have to call webElement of log in method then we use method i.e. isDisplayed() then we store this result in object and we return this object to Test class for that we have to use return and we have to change method into method with return type i.e.method with Boolean return because in variable Boolean value is store.   like 
	public boolean getSwagLabHomePageLogo()
	{
		boolean result = logo.isDisplayed();
		return result;
	}
//Here we cerate method with retrun type i.e. Boolean value is return by using this method and we call logo i.e. global variable i.e. which contains address of logo and then we call method i.e. isDisplayed i.e. if logo is present then these method show result true otherwise false.
And we store this result in variable this variable/result  is return by this method. 
Here we check that logo is present or not and this result is store in variable and this result we will return in test class. 

Now we call this method in test class. then we get result like logo is present or not then we store that result in variable then we perform verification  like logo is present or not by using Assert class or SoftAssert class methods. 
Like
@Test
	public void verifylogo() throws InterruptedException
	{
		boolean actResult = home.getSwagLabHomePageLogo();
		Assert.assertTrue(actResult,"failed: get false test case is failed "););
		
	}
Here we calling home.getSwagLabHomeLogo() which check that logo is present or not then it return result so we store result of this method i.e. actual result in variable i.e. ActResult and data type is Boolean . Then we call assert class method assertTrue() means we are excepting  result true is we get actResult true then test case is passed otherwise it show result fail with user generated messages.
So this is our proper verification in which we don’t use if else for verification we use assert class method for verification in test class.
The result which we are getting POM class we get that result i.e. actual result and in test class then we compare that result with excepted result if both result is match then test case is passed otherwise  fail. By using assert class and soft assert class method,.
This we want to compare Boolean result then we call assertTrue() or assertFalse().
When we run test case it verify if logo is present then it will pass that test case otherwise fail that test case.
Verification  is done in this way. 

 Suppose we have condition we want to compare to string value then we get actual result from POM class then we return that result to test class then we get expected  result from excel sheet in test class then we compare both result in test class by using assert class methods Assert.assertEqual() or Assert.assertNotEquals();
Then we can compare this in test class. 
Now we add this test class in test suite so we can get Emailable report. 
 
Here we integrate TestNG concept with POM DDF.

 
can we use main method and @Test annotation in same class? what will be the result if we do that?


Yes, you can use the main method and the @Test annotation in the same class. However, their behavior and outcome depend on how the class is executed.
If you run the class using the main method, the @Test annotated methods will not be executed automatically. They will behave like regular methods unless explicitly called from within the main method.
If you run the class using a testing framework like TestNG or JUnit, the testing framework will recognize the @Test annotation and execute the corresponding test methods. The main method will be ignored and not executed as part of the test execution.
To summarize, when using the main method, you have control over which methods to execute, whereas with the @Test annotation, the testing framework handles the execution of test methods.

Adding Components of framework
(yesterday code we will move in next package and we modify that code by adding more component’s of framework  like base class and utility class)
1.	Base Class 
2.	Utility class 
(in pervious test class we created code for open browser and open application and  fetching data from excel sheet and object creation in @BeforeClass method. for now we have one test class so we create code to open browser in @BeforeClass method  but if we have 100 test classes then we have to cerate this code in all 100 test classes i.e. it is  duplication of same code to avoid that duplication of code we have to remove that code from test class  we declare that code to open browser in separate class i.e. base class then we extend that base  class in all test classes. ) 
1.Base class (Framework component)
Base class is the super most class in framework we have to extend this class in all test classes because this class contains code i.e. separate method to open browser and load application.

In base class is separate class in which we have to cerate non static method in base class to open browser. And when we want to open browser in test class then we call that method in test class.
(here we remove code from test class code which used to open browser then we cerate separate class then in that class we create method in that method we declare code to open browser).
1st 
From test class we remove global variable of i.e. WebDriver driver i.e. WebDriver objectname and code to open browser we remove from test class. 
2nd 
Then we cerate separate class i.e. base class. 
3rd 
We cerate method to open / initialize browser i.e. non static method 
public class BaseClass
{
	 WebDriver m;
	public void initializeBrowser()
	{
		 m= new ChromeDriver();
		 m.get("https://www.saucedemo.com/");
		 m.manage().window().maximize();
		 m.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
		 
		 
	}
// here we cerate base class in which we declare WebDriver and object name globally then in method we initialize WebDriver object and then we write code to open / initialize browser.
4th  now we extend this Base class in Test Class
public class SwagLAbTest_Base_And_Utility extends BaseClass
As here we extend base class in test class then all properties of super class in extend/ copied in sub class i.e. Test class.
Like in test class i.e. sub class have code to open browser As well as it contains WebDriver and WebDriver object also present internally. (As we know when we perform inheritance then all properties  of super class extends in child class we can use that properties of super class in sub class.)


In test class all code is present which is available in base class like WebDriver object and method to initialize browser present internally. But we have to class that method in @AfterClass method. (because method which we declare in base class is regular method it don’t run until we call that method in main method or in Annotation method.) then we call that method of base class in @BeforeClass Annotation. 
As here @AfterClass Annotation have non- static method then we can  call non- static method in non-static method directly like methodname(); (like we can call one static method in other non static method directly as we call static method in main method directly like methodname() same way we can call non-static method in non-static method)
 
// here we give method name initializeBrowser().
1st now when we run this test class then it will run @BeforeClass first. 
then it load sheet 1st then it will open browser by executing initializeBrowser() method. Because base class code and WebDriver is present test class then it will execute this initializeBrowser() and it open browser.
 Then it will send WebDriver object to Multiple Pom Class as an input then early initialization is done here then all method of pom class will run one by one as we call them.
From we use same approach like In every test Class we extend Base Class in test class. then in Test class it get code from base class to open browser.  Then we call the method @BeforeClass method then it will open browser. 
In base Class we create code to open browser instead of creating it in Test class we create super class i.e.t Base Class. in that we Declare WebDriver object Globally then we cerate non-static method in that method we initialize WebDriver object then we write code to open Browser. Now we just extend this base class in test class. when we extend this class in test class then All the properties/ code /object presents in Base class that all properties will extends in test class. now all code is present in test class. we just have to call that method to open Browser in @BeforeClass Annotation. (As in test class all methods are non-static so we can call non-static method i.e. initializeBrowser() directly in @BeforeClass method). In Test Class WebDriver Object is also present internally as we declare it in Base class that also extends in test class so we can use WebDriver method also.


Base class is super class of project we extend this class in All test class present in project whether test class are in thousands we use same code to open browser.(because of this if after some time we have to situation like we have to update URL then We just have update that URL in base Class as we extend this class in all Test Class then it Automatically get Updated in all test classes).
Which super most Class in Framework?
Base class is super most class. we extend that class in each and every test class.
In base class it only contain code just to open browser.
In sub class we extend code which is need in each and every test class. like browser open.
In super class we create code which is needed in each and every test classes.

(Like suppose if we cerate code like to fetch data from excel sheet, handling or iframe, screenshot capture etc we don’t need this code in all test class. 
But in all test classes we have to open browser in every test class.)
Like suppose we have common functions related to selenium like fetch data from excel sheet, capture screen shoot, pop up handling etc. then we create this code in separate class i.e. Utility class. we don’t write common selenium function is test class.
We create non- static method in base class because we perform inheritance in test class in test class all methods are non-static so in test class we can call non-static method directly.

2.Utility class
In utility class we cerate separate method for each function related selenium like fetch test data from excel sheet, capture screenshot etc.
Whenever we need to fetch data from excel then we can call method present in Utility class.
We don’t extend utility class in test class. But when we need to use any selenium related function then we simply call method related to function present in test class.
Now we cerate separate class i.e. Utility class.
In that 1st we create method to fetch data fetch data from excel sheet. i.e. getData() 
(now we remove code from test class to fetch test data and global variable sheet also.)
public class Utility_Class 
{
	public static String getData(int rowIndex,int cellIndex) throws EncryptedDocumentException, IOException
	{
		 FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream("F:\\Excel\\Book1.xlsx");
		 Sheet sh = WorkbookFactory.create(file).getSheet("Sheet5");
		 String data = sh.getRow(rowIndex).getCell(cellIndex).getStringCellValue();
		 return  data;
	}

}

 // here we create static regular method in which we write code to fetch data from excel sheet.
1st we cerate object of FileInputStreamClass then we provide excel path as an input in constructor.
Then to open that excel file we have to call Workbookfactory call static method cerate() then we pass file i.e. object of fileInputStream class as an input. Then we call getSheet() method then we pass sheet name which we want to open then we store this sheet result in sh object.
As we want to fetch data from sheet  the we have to call method getRow() then we accept row index from test class (here row index and cell index is not available then we accept in from method when we call this method then we can pass input in row and cell index. Then that index value is fetch by this method)
then in that row which particular cell then we have to call method getCell()  we accept cell index from test class that why we create method with two integer parameter.

then which type of data we want to fetch like string then we call method getStringCellValue().
Now we stored the information in object i.e. data. Now we return this data as we are returning data then we have to convert method in method with return type i.e. string type data is return by this method.

When we call this method in test class then we pass row and column index then this method fetch data of that index and store in data then that data is return by this method. this method will accept parameter and return value/data also.
Here we create static method because we can call this method by using classname.methodname in any test class.(when we need to fetch data from excel sheet then we call this method by using classname.methodname i.e. Utility_Class.getData((0),(1))) then it will fetch data of index which pass and return that data also.)
We call this method when we need input from excel there we call this method to fetch data from excel.
@BeforeMethod
	public void logininApp() throws InterruptedException, EncryptedDocumentException, IOException
	{
		login.inpswagLabLoginPageUsername(Utility_Class.getData(0, 0));
		login.inpswagLabLoginPagepassword(Utility_Class.getData(0, 1));
		login.clickswagLabLoginPageLoginbutton();
		Thread.sleep(2000);
	}

Here as in user name and password we need to fetch data from excel sheet so we will call this method like. Utility_Class.getData(0,1) as it get user name and password and return data. This data/ result return by method we are using it as an input.

In utility class we can create n number of method which is related to selenium.


Here we move browser open code in Base class and code for to fetch data from excel sheet we declare it in Utility class. by this way we are breaking code.  It lenghthy process but in future when deigns script then that time all code is present in base class and Utility class so we just have to call that code in test class.
By doing this length of test class in decreasing. (previously there is to much code is present in @BeforeClass method but now we have just small code is present in @BeforeClass.
Here we minimize code we can minimize code we can minimize code when we break that code. 
We can break the code which is use repeatably. We can’t brake code which not use repeatably.
(here code i.e. browser open, fetching data then we can use this code any many test classes.)
Here in Utility class we create static methods because we don’t perform any inheritance we just call these method by using classname.methodname that why we cerate static method in utility class. when we need that method we can call directly classname.methodname.
 In base class it contain only one method i.e. to open browser and WebDriver and it object.
But in Utility class it contain many methods which are related to selenium function. Like fetch data from excel sheet, capture screen shoot, etc.

Method for capturing screenshot 
In utility class we cerate method for to capture screen shoot. Like to take screen shoot we have to perform down casting in between TakesScreenshot interface and webdriver object.
Then we have to call method i.e. getScreenShootAs() then we have to pass OutpuType.File. then we store it in object.
  public static void captureScreenShoot(WebDriver driver,int TCID)
	{
		File src = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
		
		File dec= new File("F:\\ScreenShotsel\\TCID"+TCID+".jpg");
	}
	//here 1st we have to covert webdriver object to takescreenshot interface here we are accepting /getting webDriver object from test class through method then we convert webdriver into takescreenshot now we call method i.e. getScreenshotAs() then we pass input to that method i.e. OutputType.FILE then it will capture screenshot and store in object.
Then we move this screenshot in destination folder by using File class we have to cerate object of file class then we have to pass destination folder path and name of file and file extension (like jpg,png). Here we capture screen shot like Test case having unique id As every test case have unique id we assign that id to accept id we accept from method then we concatenate this with our String File name by using + sign.
We can concatenate two string by using + symbol.
Here first break that string two part then by using string 1 + symbol + string 2 we can concatenate two string.

When ever we want to capture screen shot then we call this method then we have to pass ID to this method.
In Utility class we have to give description with method 
When ever we cerate method then we have to write description of method.
Which and how many input this method need. Discretion of inputs.
Method created by i.e. @Author name:

We have to mention this because if any one is using this method then he / she can get idea of this method what actually this method do. And if don’t understand working or any modifications then that person can contact to Author i.e. person how created this method.
 
By this way we can create method in Utility class. 


Listener In TestNG 
Listener is an interface in  which there are many interface available by using this interface i.e. ITestResult we can get status/result of current executed test method in script. ITestResult is present in Listener interface.
Methods of ITestResult 
1.getStatus().
- get result stored in object of ITestResult for that we have to call method non static of ITestResult interface i.e.  getStatus(). Return type of this getStatus () method is in present in ITestResult interface.
Screenshot of only  failed test case  
Some time we have to capture screen shot of failed test cases.
So we have to cerate code like if one of test case is falling then we have to take screen shot of that.
Like we have actual test case in @Test annotation if our actual test case is failed then we have to take screen of that. If test case is passed then we don’t have to take any screen shot.
Assign test case id to test case 
Whenever we are design test case then we have to give unique  test case id to every test case like for that we have to declare integer TCID globally and in test case we have to provide value to that variable / we have to initialize that variable in Test method.
Like
int TCID;
@Test
	public void verifylogo() throws InterruptedException
	{
		TCID=101;
		home.clickswagLabHomePageAddtocart();
		boolean actResult = home.getSwagLabHomePageLogo();
		Assert.assertTrue(actResult,"failed: get false test case is failed ");
		
	}
As we know after execution of every test case then it execute @AfterMethod. After executing each test method then test case focus is moved to after method. 
So now in after method we apply a condition like 1st we get result of test method like execution done in @Test we get result of this in @AftetrMethod is test case result is pass or skip then we don’t have to do any thing but if test case result is failed then we call code to capture screen shoot.
So to get result of test method then we have to use Listener interface present in TestNG which is used to get result of test method in test script.
Then in @AfterMethod we get result/status  of test method (which is executed) . we apply condition to get status of currently executed test method. for that we have to call interface i.e. ITestResult. ITestresult is an interface which present in listener. 
Here we call ITestResult interface  to get result of currently executed test case then we store that test method result in Object. So like we declare variable in that same way we declare ITesResult interface and object name to store result generated by Test method.
When our Test method is executed then that test method result is stored in object of ITestResult. Like status of test method like pass, fail, skip is store in this object. Now in @AfterMethod we compare that result like status of test method is passed or fail. 
Like if s1==”failed” like here we cant get result stored in s1 so for  do  that we have to call non static method of ITestResult interface i.e.  getStatus(). Return type of this getStatus () method is int and present in ITestResult interface.
Here we are getting result of test method in object s1 if status is failed then we call method to capture screen shot that will execute.  Here we can’t compare status stored of ITestResult object with string then we have to mention type of status at right side of equal to sign.
Then to get failure  result of ITestResult we have to call ITestResult.FAILURE
	if(s1.getStatus()==ITestResult.FAILURE)
//now the parameter which is present at right hand side that always return failure status. Then in left hand side parameter get result generated by test method. Then we compare that with status stored in ITestResult object. If status if Failure Then it will capture the screen shot. 
(now whenever we run test case then that test case have some result like pass, failed or skipped then that result is stored in ITestResult object s1 then in @AfterMethod body we compare that actual result stored in object with ITestResult.FAILURE if its match then it will capture screen shot. In other status if other than FAILURE then it Don’t enter in if body.)
@AfterMethod
	public void logoutfromApp(ITestResult s1) throws InterruptedException, IOException
	{
		
		if(s1.getStatus()==ITestResult.FAILURE)
		{
			Utility_Class.captureScreenShoot(m, TCID);
		}
		home.clickswagLabHomePageOpenmenu();
		menu.clickswagLabMenuPageLogoutbutn();
		Thread.sleep(2000);
	}
In if body we call method to capture screen shot that method is present in UtilityClass then we call that method classname.methodame as it is static method. so we have to pass two input 1st in webDriver object and 2nd is Test Case id. We get WebDriver object from base class as we extend that class in Test class and we get Test case id from test method as we declare TCID globally and then we initialize locally. Now having this two parameter it goes to Utility class then it will capture screenshot and store in destination folder have name of TestCaseID101 i.e. here is concatenate string and integer input comping from test class.
Now if the Test Method is failed then it only capture screen shot otherwise it don’t capture screen shot.
(now we force fully failed this test method for that as logo is present means we get True and we are using assert class method assertTrue() but we want fail that test case so we call assertFalse () here actually logo is present means we get true but accepting false and getting true then test case is result failed) now this will capture screen shot having name like  .
As here we give Test case id so it comes easy while analysing which test cases are fail.
So this program capture the screen shot failed test case for that we are using Listener by using ITestResult we are getting result of current test case and that result is stored in object then we comparing actual result of test case stored in ITestObject for to get actual test stored in object we are using getStatus() then we compare actual status with ITestResult.FAILURE if both status is match then it will take screen shot.)
(if we have two test case and if 1st test case is failed then it will capture screen shot for 1st test method then execute 2nd test case. TCID is unique like if we assign 102 to 2nd test case and we are executing test case 2 then for now TCID have value 102 and if this test case is fail then it will capture screen shot.)

This will capture screen shot if result of test case is failed. Depend on test case status it will capture screen only if results is Fail or FALIURE.
Capture Screenshot of only Failed TC

listner(interface):
ItestResult

To get test case status we need to use listener(interface) in TestNG.

Property file 
(Framework component)
In property file we can store important login credentials of application like User name, password and URL of applications we store it in property file.
we don’t stored important login  credential in excel we store it in property file (this file is like text file.) from this file we fetch this data. 
And we need test inputs in @Test we store that information in excel sheet . but we store data like which is used login credentials and URL we store it in separate property file.
From now we store login credentials and URL of application in property file and we stored data i.e. test data which is need in @Test method in excel file.
We stored login credentials and URL in property file.
Step to  Create properties file.
1st we cerate property file then we add data within it then we fetch data then we use that data in script.
Step1 : create properties file  in eclipse
While creating property file we have to use “.properties” extensions along with name of file.
1.	We have to right click on project name.
2.	Click on new 
 

3.	Click on other 
 

4.	Then click on general then file then next 

 
5.	Then we have to give file name file name can be any thing but we have to assign extension i.e. .properties.
 
6.	Then click on Finish then we can see this file created.
 
 
Step2 : then we have store data into properties file 
Now we data in this file then we can call this data in file.
Data stored in property file in the from of keys and values pair. Key we have to assign unique across the file.
open file in Eclipse and stored data within it.
Like 
Key=value
URL=https://www.facebook.com/
 
Here we create property file and then we stored data within it.
 
Step 3: then we use that data in script / reading data from properties files.
Then to fetch data from property file then we have to create common functions in Utility class.
 As we create function/method to fetch data from excel that same way we fetch data from property for that we have to follow some steps like.
1st we have to cerate on static method 
2nd now to read data present in property file we have to navigate to that property file for that we have to find path of property file.
For that we have to cerate object of FileInputStream class like
FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream(“ ”);
Then we have to find path of property file then we send that property file path to constructor. 
To find path of property file/ any file present in eclipse we have to right click on property file name. then we have to click on properties then we can get path of property file.
 
Then we have to copy this path then we have to send this path to constructor as string input.
Setp1: navigate to property file.
FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream("D:\\eclipse\\PropertyFile\\SwagLab.properties");
For now are navigate to path of property file. But to open that file we have to call non- static method i.e. load() which is present in properties  class so as it is an non- static method then we have create object of properties class. 
Step2: here we open property file by creating object of properties class and calling non-static method i.e. load() and we pass path of property file which we store in FileInputStream class object i.e. file.
Properties p= new Properties();
p.load(file);
Now we have to call non-static method like objectname.load() we have to pass file i.e. object of properties class as an input where we store path of properties file path.
Now file is open now to get value of particular key present in property file then we have to call properties class non- static method. I.e. getProperty() like
Objectname.getProperty();
p.getProperty(); 
we have to send string key to this method. So it will retrun value assign to that key. But currently we don’t have value then we accept key from method. 
 
Then we store the value which is return by this method in variable and then we return that value. now we have to covert this method into return type as it returning string value. (whenever we don’t have value available then we accept that value from method).
Now whenever we call this method in then we have to pass String key like. “URL”, “username”, “password”, etc.
This method return value where we call this method. 

By using this method we can use in script. When ever we want inputs like Login credentials, URL then we can use this method.
Now we have to make change in base class before we are mentioning URL directly in get() but now we have to call this method to fetch the URL from property file. 
Like 
driver.get(UtilityClass.getPropertyFileData(“URL”);
here we call UtilityClass method getPropertyFileData() then we pass String key i.e. URL now it will fetch URL in Utility Class then store in value i.e. value is return by that method now value is sent to this get() of WebDriver then URL will get open.
 
Now as we want need user name and password in test class that input also we fetch these data from property file for that we use utility  class method i.e. UtilityClass.getPropertyFileData() then we pass string key i.e. uername and password 
Like
 
(Now we convert our code on property file.)
In property file we store only important login credentials and URL. And other input which are need for to use in script that data we will store it excel sheet.



Property file selenium:
	To store imp login creadentials of application eg. UN, PWD, YOB, URL

Step 1) Creating a properties file in eclipse
	1. Right-click on the main project folder and Select New-> Other->select General -> File and click on 'Next' button->
		Provide a valid file name with the extension '.properties' on the new file resource window and click on 'Finish' button

Step 2) Storing data into properties file
	Data is stored in properties file in the form of key-value pairs, with the key being unique across the file.
	Open  file in Eclipse and store some data
	eg- URL= https://kite.zerodha.com/


Step 3) Reading data from properties file
	FileInputStream file= new FileInputStream(System.getProperty("user.dir")+"\\credentials.properties");
	Properties obj = new Properties(); 	
	obj.load(file);
	String value= obj.getProperty("URL");

Folders in project 
In our project we have to create folder to store excel file where we can store test data then we have to create folder in project to store screenshot of failed test cases and then we have to crate folder the store the webdriver exe file like. chromedriver.exe, etc.
We have to cerate separate folder to store different types of folder in project. 
So we create folder structure in our project. 
To create folder in our project 
1.	We have to right click on project name then 
2.	New then we have to click on new folder/folder 
 
3.	Then click on folder then we have to give name to folder then click on finish button 
 
4.	Then folder is created in our project structure we can see it.
 
5.	Then in this folder we have to store our excel sheet. From our pc 
 

6.	Then we have to paste that file in our project 
 
7.	Here we can click on that folder then we can see that excel file is stored in that folder
 
From now we have to stored all file related to project in our project. 

3.	We  have to store chrome browser driver exe file in to project folder for that also we have to cerate folder in our project like BroswerFiles now in this folder we will store browser files.
 here just we have to copy that exe file from our pc then we have to paste in our project folder.

4.	As we capture screenshot of failed test case then that screenshot also we have to stored in our project we have to create separate folder. Like  
Here we created folder to store failed test case screen shot.

Now As we created folder and stored files in that folder then we have to update path in our test script in Utility class and base class. As in utility class we have method to get / fetch data from excel sheet so there also we have to update path of excel file and in screenshot capture method we have to update path to store screenshot in project folder.

 in base class we have code to open browser then also we have to update chromedriver path.
 So we have to update path in base and utility class. 





















1.	To get path of file store in project folder we have to right click on file the properties 
 
2.	Then we see path of file we have to copy that path then we have to update that path in where we want to update that file path.
After running test case we have to refresh project to see screen shot of failed test cases in our project.
We have to give .png extension to screen shot then it open in ecplise .jgp is not open eclipse. We can see all screen shot stored in local drive/ pc for that we have to click on  button present after path.
 
After clicking on that arrow we can directly navigate to folder in our pc where that file is stored. 

 
 


From now we store all file related to project in folder in eclipse by createing folder in our project. Then we have to fetch data from that file which is stored in project folder. Like we have to stored data like screenshot in current project folder.
 Here all our file are stored in our project in different folders.
In excel one row is assign for one test case to store data.

Maven project: 
Maven is a powerful build automation tool for Java projects. It simplifies the development process by managing dependencies, compiling source code, and packaging applications into distributable formats.
The pom.xml (Project Object Model) is a configuration file used in Maven projects. It contains project details, dependencies, and build instructions. Maven reads this file to perform various tasks like resolving dependencies and executing build operations. It acts as a blueprint for building and managing Java projects.
By using Maven, we can easily manage project dependencies, maintain a consistent project structure, and automate the build process. It simplifies the project setup and reduces the manual effort required to manage libraries and build the application.
Overall, Maven provides a standardized and efficient way to develop and manage Java projects, making it a popular choice for developers and teams working on Java-based applications.

(now we have to move all our code of framework in our maven project. Previously we created project in  general folder in general folder it don’t have addition features and don’t create any structure. So from now we have to cerate maven project).
(this maven project don’t support all eclipse. It have some setup issue.) 
How to create maven project 
Step 1:  cerate Maven project 
1.	to create maven project click on  file then click on project then select Maven 
 
2.	Then click on maven folder then expand it then we some options in that 
 
3.	Click on maven project then click on next 
4.	Then click on cerate a simple project check box
 
5.	Then we have to give Group id and Artifact Id here Group id means Package name and Artifact id means Project name( this all setup id one by frame  work developer). Then click on finish button.
 
6.	Here Maven project is cerate in our Eclipse
Here we can identify that this project is general project or Maven project there is M and J is present on Maven project. And on general project only I is present. If we see J and M then it means that it is Maven plus java project. J means java project.


 
When expand it then we see above project structure in which we only important is i.e. src/main/java and src/test/java We don’t need resources if we delete that also fine or if it remains that also fine.(we remove all resources like src/main/resources and src/test/resources)
Now project structure is like 
 
This all are important files then one folder also generated automatically i.e. Maven dependencies.
So 
1.	src/main/java
2.	src/test/java
3.	maven dependencies
4.	pom.xml file 
all this files are important files.

Now here project is created i.e. Maven Project.
Step 2: Add jar files /dependencies
Here we don’t add jar files. For one jar file we add one dependency. dependency means it is 4 lines code. Like if we to add selenium jar file then we add one dependency for to add selenium jar i.e. 4 lines code. For one jar file one dependency  is added.
We found this dependency code on mvnrepository.com/ site. We have to visit this website then we have to search for decency which we want to add in our maven project. Then we can copy that code and add that code into pom.xml  file.
Like here we want to add selenium jar file means for one jar file we have to add one dependency. Dependency is 4 line code which we get on https://mvnrepository.com/ maven repository site then we search
 
3.	Then click on selenium java first option  
Then we see all version of selenium list we can choose which version we want to use 
 
4.	Like if we want to add jar file of selenium 4.6.0 then click on that then we get dependency code for that like
Then we just copy paste that code and we paste that code in our maven project pom.xml file.
 
Then we just copy paste that code and we paste that code in our maven project pom.xml file.
5.	Now we add dependency in pom.xml file
 
Here project open and close then we have to add dependencies in project then in between project open and close we have to add that dependencies for that we have to open keyword i.e. dependencies  like <dependencies> and in between this we can add many single dependency </dependencies>. Like in between classes open and close we can add many single class like that same way we can add many single dependency in between dependencies.
 
6.	Here we add dependency for selenium just by copy paste when we save by using CTRL+ s then all selenium jar file download automatically.
Then refresh project  we can see

7.	Maven dependencies folder is created and all jar file is stored in this folder 
 
 
Like we want to Add Apache POI file jar file then we have search for Apache poi then we see all option then we have to click on 
 
Then we see all version of Apache POI jar file version then we click on 5.1.0
 
Then here we copy this dependency code from here to paste in our project pom.xml file in body of dependencies 
 
Here all Apache POI files are also stored in Maven Dependencies folder. While Adding this File We should have connect our system to internet then it download and add this jar file in Maven Dependencies folder 
Advantage of Maven dependencies
If in future if we want to update version of jar file then we simply change version number in our pom.xml file in that we change dependency version number only  like selenium 4.6.0 to 4.7.0 then we only change version name then it automatically download that new jar file and old jar file is remove automatically. (so we don’t need to delete old version here we just edit version number then it automatically delete and update new version we just have to change version number of jar file).
If we want to update the version of jar file then we just change the version number then maven dependencies automatically update the version delete old version.
 
Like
 
Here we can see that as we change version number it automatically download new jar file for 5.2.0
 
(now when we download jar file then in that in one jar file are stored in one jar file but here it download speared jar file for each browser like chrome, etc but not problem we can use same as it is.)

In step one we create project then in step2 we add dependency in project i.e. add jar files by using pom.xml file. Here we don’t add manually here we go to https://mvnrepository.com/ site then copy despondency of jar file like selenium and Apache POI add that dependency in body of dependencies  of project body of pom.xml file then it automatically downloads jar file and stored in maven dependencies folder.(so from now we don’t have to do that manually like build path and all).
Now framework developer will added all file like if we need browser file like. chrome.exe file, to stored screenshot we need folder then we need folder to stored test data i.e. excel file, and property file then he will setup all this things.
Step 3 : add folders in maven project 
1.	Browser folder
Like first is browser folder in that we stored browser file like chrome.exe, edge.exe, etc.
 
2.	Test data
Then add excel file 
3.	FailedTestCaseSS
4.	Property file
Now we have(he add) to enter data inside property file URL, user name and password.
Now framework developer will add all file in this folder and information in property file.
Here we all information and data in folder and files 
 
(here in maven we add jar by using decencies and here get stander structure )
Step 4  : cerate Library Files 
Now frame work developer we will cerate Library file likes Base Class, Utility class and ExtentReportManeger class is created by Framework developer. In src/main/java. He will create package in src/main/java i.e. LibraryFiles
(We have a already base class and Utility class then we move them in src/main/java  i.e. LibraryFiles)
 
Now in this package it contains All library file like base class and Utility class is stored inside that. 
 
(here we have to update then path of folder and file inside utility and Base class)
We have to set path of files and folder.
Here by doing this all file are access by current folder and stored ss in folder in project.
Step 5: git hub and Jenkins set up
Now framework developer will set up git hub and Jenkins.
For now Framework developer work is complete means all basic framework is designed by framework developer.  It include project creation, adding jar files, folder structure creation adding files  and Library files setup, git hub and Jenkins setup this all is done by framework developers.
(after completing framework he will share this with team by using git hub ( if the code is created by framework developers or teams lead they will share by using git hub).
Onwards team will work on this framework. 
Step 6: Design Test Scripts using already created Framework
As tester we will create test scripts by using already designed framework.
Here as automation test engineer we will get some manual test cases then we will properly read that test cases then we figure out how many test steps are there and if in test scripts we have to navigate numbers web page then we will cerate POM class for each Web page then to run that we create test class. and input which are need to run that test class we cerate that test input test input file folder.
For we have to start developing automation test scripts. Here we develop script on already developed framework.
Suppose in our project if there are 7-8 module then at time we have to work on one module. Then we have to crated POM and Test classes of that particular module. 
In src/main/java folder we stored all POM classes and / library files
In src/test/java folder we cerate all test classes.
  (like suppose if we are working on login module then we have to Create POM classes and Test class for that module. )
 So in src/main/java we cerate package having module name i.e. login module in that package we cerate all POM classes related to login page. 
 
Here we create package in src/main/java for login module in that package we have to cerate POM classes for login module related .
To run this POM classes we need test Class So We to run POM classes of login module then we have to create Package in src/test/java in this folder we have test cerate one  package which contains all test classes related one particular module i.e. login 
 
Here we created on package in side src/test/java i.e. Module1_Login_Test in this we store all test classes which is related to login module.
 We store all POM classes which related to Login we store that POM classes in src/main/java folder package i.e. Module1_Login and in scr/test/java folder we create package i.e. Module1_login_Test which  Only contains test classes related login module only.
Here we give Test because we can easily identify that its test class package.
 If in our project if we have to 10 module then all POM classes of One module separate package is created in src/main/java and for each module related test classes are also store in separate packages in src/test/java separate packages are created for every module POM classes are stored in src/main/test folder and test classes are stored in src/test/java folder.
(like All team members will cerate separate package for each module For Pom classes and test classes.)
 
Here separate packages are created for POM and test classes in src/main/java folder and src/test/java folder. 
Pom.xml file we add dependencies and  dependency for that jar file is downloaded from https://mvnrepository.com/ site.
Then this jar file are stored and downloaded in to maven dependencies  folder.

In scr/main/java we create one package for one module in which in contains n numbers of POM classes of that particular module 
src/test/java- we create separate package for one module and in that module we can store n number of test classes related to that particular module 
(now we have to cerate packages now add  POM classes and test classes in this package.)(here we have ready-made POM and test classes we just Paste here and we reuse that package.)
(we cerate page for that module then we can call that class in other test classes also.)
(but we stored in pages for that particular page for particular module).
(here we move previous code in POM and Test classes.) but in real time we cerate POM and Test classes.
Here we have to handle errors in test classes..
1st error TestNG Annotation here we don’t add TestNG so We have to Hoover mouse on @Annotation then we have to click on  Add TestNG library   
 2nd all Classes are different- different packages so we have to import all classes.(when we create object of class or call method then we have to import that classes of other packages).
By using CRTL+SHIFT+O we can import all at time.  
3rd we can to change scope of Base class Global variable driver default to public. Because scope of default variable scope is remains only in package but scope of public access specifiers are throughout project.
Now when we run Test class then access file from maven  project. Here we don’t add library file manually.
We can add class in suite also.
(this is last modification this our final Framework).
(We can Share the project also like we have to copy project from eclipse then we have to drive where we want to store. Project is nothing but it is an folder structure. So here we store folder in store then we covert it into zip then we can share the project. 
And we can import also for that we have to click on file then import option then we have to select which type of project is general or Maven then we have to choose file form drive then it get imported in eclipse workspace.)

Step1: Create maven Project:
File-> New -> Project -> Maven ->Maven Project -> next ->()- Enter group id(Package name) ->Enter Artifact id(Project name)-> Finish


group id: Package name
Artifact id: Project name

src/main/java folder
src/test/java folder
pom.xml file
maven dependencies folder 
    

Step2: Add jar files/dependencies
1 jar file-> 1 dependency -> 4 lines code--> mvnrepository.com website--> pom.xml file --> download --> maven dependencies folder

Step3: Create folders 
browsers
Screenshots
TestData
PropertyFile

Step4: Create Library Files
UtilityClass
BaseClass
Note: update path -> chromedriver.exe file, excel sheet, property file, screenshot folder


Step5: github & jenkins setup



Step6: Design TestScript using already created framework

src/main/java folder--- all Pom classes/ library files
src/test/java folder--- All test classes
maven dependencies folder  --> All downloaded jar files
pom.xml file    --> To add dependencies--> use to download jar files from mvnrepository

src/main/java -->1 module--> 1 Package -->n no of pom classes
src/test/java -->1 module--> 1 Package -->n no of test classes
1 jar--> 1 dependency-->  4 lines of code -->mvnRepository.com


copy already existing POM & Test Classes

Note: Remove Error
Add TestNG Library
shortcut for imports  --> control + Shift + O 
make webdriver object to public 


import maven project in workspace
file->import->maven->existing maven project->browse maven project
like we have to explain framework in less word but in effective manner. We have to give highlight or what is use of that element in our framework. We just have to give jut intro of all framework component use in our project.

Maven :
Maven is project / build management Tool.
Maven Phases
Which are phases of maven ?
There are 5 Phases of maven 
1)	Validate 
2)	Compile
3)	Test 
4)	Packaging
5)	Install
1)	Validate : In Validation it will Validate the code for proper information.
Validating the information. It will validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available.
2)	Compile : In Compile it will compile project/source code  and check that is there any kind of error present or not.
Source code compilation is done in this phase 
3)	Test : In Test it will run code.
Test the compiled source code of the framework.
4)	Packaging : In This it will convert the code into  jar or war file so that we can use this code into another project if required.
This phase Creates the JAR/WAR package of the project.
5)	Install: In install it store this jar /war files in local repository of maven i.e. .m2.
This phase installs the package in local repository.

When we run any maven project the in will execute in this five phases.   To run this phases there are some maven command by which we can run Maven project.

 When we run any phase like test then phases which are present before that will execute first like if we run test then first validate will run then compile then test. 


To run phases we can run thorough ide 
Right click on pom.xml
 
To run validate /compile right click pom.xml
Then click on Maven build 
 
We have to set goals which phase we want to run. Then it will execute that.

Maven Command
1)	mvn clean :
 this command will delete all file/data which generated by pervious execution data which not required for further executions. It will delete data present in target folder.
2)	mvn compile: it will compile the source code.
3)	mvn test: it will start execution of script.
4)	mvn install: it will start execution and create jar and store in .m2 repository


We can execute this command through ide and Command prompt also.

To run scripts through CMD 1st we have to navigate to path of  our project though CD command i.e. change disc or we can directly navigate to project path and hit cmd in sreach bar there then terminal open then simply enter any command which we want to execute like mvn test or any command.

Here execution is done through pom.xml it will call test suite then test suite call the classes present in suite.
in Maven when we add dependencies then through POM.XML then that dependencies are stored in maven dependencies folder in project and in our system in store in .m2 repository of maven which is present at location i.e. 
C:\Users\daduk\.m2\repository

To run Project through maven we have to configure/ add  plugin.
1)	Maven Compiler plugin: 
2)	Maven Surefire plugin:

1)	Maven compiler plugin:
To add maven compiler plugin google it  and click on 1st website  then click on Usage 
https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-compiler-plugin/usage.html
<build>
    <pluginManagement>
      <plugins>
        <plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.11.0</version>
        </plugin>
      </plugins>
    </pluginManagement>
  </build>
Here frombuild we have to copy all here no need any configuration needed in compiler plugin .

2)	Maven surefire plugin:
Then we have to add maven surefire plugin
https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/usage.html
in  surefire plugin is necessary to run project through pom.xml.
In surefire plugin we have to done some configuration by using <configuration>tag to run testNG test suite. 
<plugin>
          <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
          <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
          <version>3.1.2</version>
         	 <configuration>
          		<suiteXmlFiles>
         		 <suiteXmlFile>testng.xml</suiteXmlFile> <!-- to add single file  -->
         	 </suiteXmlFiles>
          	</configuration>
        </plugin>

Maven Report:
Are store in 
 
In surefire report we can see sub folder in that 
 

Framework Explanation:

Explain your selenium framework?
1.	Type of Framework -DDF (Data driven Framework)
1.	In my Organization To perform automation we are using Data driven framework DDF.
2.	Maven Project 
1.	In data driven framework We use the Maven project. 
2.	In Maven Project we are using POM (Page Object Module) With Page Factory design Patten to design test Script.
3. POM (Page Object Module) With page Factory design pattern.
1. In Page Object Design pattern each web page is considered as POM class
2.  and all the elements are present on that particular web are considered as an variable of POM class. 
3. POM Follows the Encapsulation concept i.e.
1.  declare variable globally by using private access specifier.
2. and we initialize that variable within constructor and scope of constructor is public 
pageFactory.initElements(driver,this); 
•	driver: It is the instance of the WebDriver class that is used to interact with the web browser.
•	this: It refers to the current instance of the Page Object class that needs to be initialized.

3. and we use that variable in side method and scope of method is public.
Maven advantages
1.	To provide standard structure to mange project 

1.src/main/java Where all POM classes and Library Files are stored in src/main/java folder.
2. src/test/javaAnd all Test Classes are Stored in src/test/java folder.
3. pom.xml file →We have one important xml file in our Maven project i.e. pom.xml where we can add decencies in our project.(to stored dependencies  of project).
4.  maven dependencies  when we add that dependencies i.e. jar file are Stored and download in automatically maven Decencies folder.
(we have to give one liner answer for all important folder like where what we are going store).
5.	Base Class
1.	In our project we have super most class i.e. Base class which is extends into all Test classes. (This is inheritance use in our project here this super class i.e. Base class is extends in each and  all Test classes )
6.	Programming Language and Automation Tool :
In our framework i.e. DDF we are using Java Programming language and Selenium WebDriver As an automation tool.
( Farmwork component: 1. DDF
2.	Maven 
3.	POM 
4.	Base class 
5.	Java selenium 
6.	TestNG 
This all are components of farmwork)
7.	TestNG  
In our framework we are using TestNG i.e. Java unite framework to Design all Test Classes or design of All Test classes.
Role or Advantage of TestNG to use in Our Framework 
(Why we are using TestNG?)
1.	Emailable report : By using TestNG we can generate reports email able reports.
2.	Suite: 
By using Test Suite we can run multiple classes at same time.
3.	We can perform Grouping.
4.	Parallel execution  is also possible
5.	Compatibility Testing is also possible by using TestNG 
6.	Annotations : 
There are many Annotations are present if we have so pre and post condition available for test Methods.
7.	Keywords :
There are many Key Words are also available in TestNG like we can assign propriety to methods, we can disable execution of test method. if one test case taking to much time for execution then we can assign time for that method also in milliseconds.
 This all possible by using keywords.

8.	 Folder Structures 
1.	Browsers / BrowserFiles: 
In Browsers Folder we store all browser related .exe files. Like chromedriver.exe file, geeko.exe file, etc.
2.	FailedTestCasesScreenShot:
In this folder we stored all failed test cases screenshots.
3.	TestData 
In TestData Folder we store excel file.
( in frameworks we have to explain where we involved.)
9.	Property File:
In our framework we use the Property file to store all important credentials of application like user name, passwords and URL of application. this information is stored in property file.
10.	Log4j
To Stored/ save log of execution we use Log4j jar file in our Framework.

(Log  Means when run one of the script then some messages are generated in console that messages are called are log.  The messages (i.e. user generated messages or system generated message) we get in console after running test script that all are called as log. 
So to save all messages generated by script then we have to make use of log4j jar files. 
We have to save logs because like we have 10 test cases and we run that test cases then we get some messages in our console but we don’t have time to analysis that messages. And immediately we have to run other 10 test execution then at this time if we don’t use log4j jar file then previous test cases execution result is get overrides with new test cases execution message. 
So in this case if we want to save messages of previous test execution messages because we don’t analysis previous test messages so in this case have to used log4j jar file.
This Log4j jar files are setup by framework developer. As junior we have to modify POM and test classes in existing framework. 
Log4j file is jar file we have to configure that with our framework, then we have to cerate some code in utility class then whenever we preform execution of test class then it automatically save that messages in text file stored in  separate folder i.e. logfile where all test execution messages are stored text file. And this file are not override if in a day if we perform execution ten time then also we for each execution messages are stored in separate text file for each run. Having current data and time it will save text file every run. So we an analysis the test result after when we get time.
All test execution messages/ log are stored by log4j in text file very time it will generate separate file for each run. 
To generate the logs in selenium framework we need to use of log4j jar files.
Log4j is an open source logging Framework (API)
By using Log4j we can store selenium automation flow logs, in file or databases.(all the messages generated by  test script is stored in  file by  log 4j. all setup is done by framework developer. In project there is separate folder is present by using that folder we can access all log file.)
This Log4j Works in 3 steps 3 
Log4j has 3 principle components which are
1.	Loggers –
It is responsible for logging information.  Like to generate message. Like we generate messages by using reporter.log that it use to generate messages. Generate messages. In ( console)
2.	 Appendence 
Use to deliver log events to there detitanations means messages which are generated that messages are moved in separate file.
We can say that appendence are use to wite logs in file. (messages which are generated on console that messages are moved in file this done by Appendence.)
3.	Layouts:
It is responsible for formatting logging information in different style. Like if we want to change fonts and colour we can done this by using layouts.

So these are all steps of log4j is setup by framework developer. This code of this log4j is present in our framework we just have to call that )

(I use log file which are generated already but code for log4j is already develop by framework developer. We are to involved in code creation or we using already written code.)
11.	Extend reporter Jar file 
In our framework we are using extend reporter to generate reports. 
(here we don’t use emailable  report generated by TestNG we use extend reporter to generate reports)
1.	We generate reports by using extend reporter because it have advantage like we can get reports in PIE chart, like how many % of test cases are pass and how many of them is failed. By using PIE chart representation.
2.	 Like we can attach screenshot for failed test cases direct with report.( screenshot is also present in folder also. we can directly attach it to report also by using of extend report ).
3.	Every time extend report is don’t  override, every time it generate new  report (of recent test script execution result). (like if we run one test script and after that we again run another test case then at time it will overrider previous test execution result with recent test case execution.)
<suite name="Suite">
<listeners>
<listener class-name="LibraryFiles.ExtentManegar"/>
</listeners>
  <test thread-count="5" name="Test">
    <classes>
      <class name="Wobb_ai_Post_Campaign_Test.Wobb_ai_Post_Campaign_Test"/>
      <class name="Wobb_ai_Sign_in_Test.Wobb_ai_Sign_in_Test"/>
   	 <class name="Wobb_ai_SignUp_Page_Test.Sign_Up_PageTest"/>
    </classes>
  </test> <!-- Test -->
</suite> <!-- Suite -->
Like for extend report also one file create in our project folder i.e. reporter folder this extend reporter file stored. 
 
(To use jar file we have to do some set up that set up is also done by framework developer. We have to just perform execution and result of current execution is stored in reporter folder. This extent reporter file is also an HTML file we can directly open it or open with browser)
We can change the them in extent reports also. we can see result / report in pie chart green means pass, orange means failed and blue means skipped.
We on left hand side we can see name of every test cases. When we click on that test case then we get result of that test case like pass, failed if failed then we see screen shot also. 
  

12.	Utility class/ 
To create selenium related common functions we use the Utility class for example, handling of drop down , capture screenshot, fetching test data from excel sheet, get property file data, handling of iframe common function are created in Utility class. 
We create separate class in which we have to created all selenium related functions.
(Class name of Utility class may change also common function like that )

13.	 Git hub repository 
To store source code of  framework  on git hub repository.
In our framework to stored then source code (means a code which we write on daily basis, like POM classes , Test classes, screen shots  we store this code on central location i.e. git hub at the end of day.)  of farmwork.
Like as we store all important data on cloud that same way we can store all our important code on git hub repository. Like all code which made  on every day we will upload that code on git hub repository. For to maintain framework.
14.	Jenkins CI
In our framework we use Jenkins as an CI tool. To schedule any job.

In Jenkins, like we have scenario we have to run one program every day at mid night or early morning and it took 5-6 hr to complete execution then we have to analysis the report of that  run. 
Like we in this type of situation Jenkins is used to run the test case or scripts on time which we schedule on that. Like Jenkins is work as alarm. Like Jenkin is an web base application in which we set code/ suite which we want to run and we mention time also when we want to run that code. And we also add email so it will send report of that run on our mail id. Now every day it will run that code on our given time and after that run it will send result like extent reports and log file  on our email id which we mention.
Like we give all this details is called as Job scheduling. So every day it will connect with server machine and open eclipse on assign pc with that server and run all code and then it will send message on our email id. (Jenkins setup is already made developer we just have to add code.)
Like we want to run one test case on particular time and we want to report of that run then it  is possible by using Jenkins CI tool. (CI means Continuous Integration).
Like suppose we have to give report to client then we can give extent reports. 
(Like in 1st round of execution if we run 100 test cases then in that run 20 test cases are failed then in next round we have to run that 20 test cases like 2nd time we another get one result of execution means now we have to 2 report’s of this test suite now we combine that both report and then we in excel sheet we mention all test cases and we also mention it result and reason of failure we have to mention and if there is bug then we add bug ID also now  like this excel file and 2 reports we have  send to client. )
 

2.	Type of Framework: Data-Driven Framework (DDF) The organization follows a Data-Driven Framework (DDF) for test automation. DDF is a testing approach where test data is separated from test scripts. It allows us to execute the same test script with multiple sets of test data, enabling efficient testing of different scenarios.
3.	Maven Project: The automation project is structured as a Maven project. Maven is a build automation tool used for managing project dependencies, building, and packaging the project. It provides a standardized project structure and simplifies the management of libraries and dependencies. Maven helps manage the project, handle dependencies, and keep everything organized.
4.	Page Object Model (POM) with Page Factory: The framework is designed using the Page Object Model (POM) pattern, where each web page is represented as a separate class (POM class). In POM each element present on web page is considered as a variable in POM class. POM strictly follows the encapsulation concept of java so this each web element is declared globally by suing @FindBy with private access specifier and initialize within public constructor by using PageFactory class method initElements () and for each webElement separate/ individual methods are created. To make them ready to use.
5.	Advantages of POM with Page Factory:
•	It makes our code easier to maintain and read.
•	We can update the web elements without affecting the test code.
•	We can reuse code, reducing duplication.
•	Easy to update and manage if there are any changes in the application's UI
5	Maven Build Plugins: 
The pom.xml file contains essential Maven build plugins. For example, the maven-surefire-plugin configures test execution and the maven-compiler-plugin ensures proper compilation of the code. These plugins ensure smooth execution and compilation of the project.
6	TestNG for Test Execution:
•	TestNG is our testing framework that runs the test scripts. It uses annotations like @Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest to manage test execution.
TestNG, a popular testing framework, is used to run test scripts. It provides annotations like @Test, @BeforeTest, @AfterTest, etc., to manage pre and post-conditions of test cases. TestNG's data providers support data-driven testing, enabling us to execute tests with multiple test data sets.
7	Logging with Log4j: 
For effective logging during test execution, the framework uses Log4j, an open-source logging library. Log4j captures and saves log messages, providing insights into test execution flow and potential issues. It helps in debugging and monitoring the test run.( The framework uses Log4j for logging purposes. Log4j is an open-source logging framework that captures and saves log messages generated during test execution. It helps in tracking test execution flow and debugging issue)
8	Extent Reports: The framework generates test reports using Extent Reports, an HTML reporting library. Extent Reports provide detailed and interactive reports with pie charts and screenshots for easy result analysis. It also allows attaching screenshots for failed test cases. Extent Reports for Detailed Test Reports: Extent Reports, an HTML reporting library, is utilized to generate detailed and interactive test reports. These reports include pie charts, screenshots for failed test cases, and test case summaries, making it easy to analyze test results.
9 Base Class
In our project we have super most class i.e. Base class which is extends into all Test classes. (This is inheritance use in our project here this super class i.e. Base class is extends in each and  all Test classes )
9	
10	Utility Class for Common Functions: 
The framework includes a dedicated Utility class that houses common functions like handling dropdowns, capturing screenshots, reading test data from Excel files, and fetching properties from property files. The Utility class promotes code reusability and maintains consistency across test scripts.
We have a Utility class that contains common functions, like handling dropdowns and capturing screenshots. It helps keep our code clean and reusable.
15.	Folder Structures 
4.	Browsers / BrowserFiles: 
In Browsers Folder we store all browser related .exe files. Like chromedriver.exe file, geeko.exe file, etc.
5.	FailedTestCasesScreenShot:
In this folder we stored all failed test cases screenshots.
6.	TestData 
In TestData Folder we store excel file.
( in frameworks we have to explain where we involved.)
16.	Property File:
In our framework we use the Property file to store all important credentials of application like user name, passwords and URL of application. this information is stored in property file.

•	GitHub Repository for Version Control:
1.	Our source code is stored in a Git repository. Git helps us track changes, work together, and go back to previous versions if needed.
•	Jenkins for Continuous Integration:
1.	Jenkins automates the process of building and testing our code. We can schedule test runs and receive test reports via email.
In a nutshell, our Selenium framework is well-structured and efficient. It lets us automate tests easily, manage test data effectively, and generate informative test reports.
5	
OOP’s concept in project 
In our framework where and which OOPs concept we use?
1st OOPs concept i.e. Interface 
Interface:
WebDriver is an interface, WebElement, ITestResult, JavaScriptExecutor, TakeScreenshot this all are the interface which we are used in selenium.
Like 
1.	while opening    browser then WebDriver  is an interface. 
2.	While taking screenshot  also we use TakeScreenshot interface.
3.	While performing scrolling also we use JavascriptExecutor interface.

1. Interface: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	  In this statement WebDriver is nothing but interface in selenium.
TakesScreenshot,JavaScriptExecutor ,ItestResult, Webdriver,WebElement

2nd is upcasting 
Up casting 
Up casting means accessing sub class properties into super class.
We perform up  casting in our framework i.e. statement which used to open browser. 
WebDriver driver= new ChromeDriver();
Like we create object of ChromeDriver and return property to the Super interface i.e. WebDriver all properties of WebDriver which is present  in ChromeDriver only that properties are return to super interface i.e. WebDriver and stored in Object i.e. driver.
Like sub class i.e. ChromeDriver propertie i.e. WebDriver properties  present inside that only that properties are return to Super Interface i.e. WebDriver. Assigning sub class properties to super interface.
Statement which is used to open browser is called as Up casting Statement.
2. UPCASTING: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	  above statement is nothing but UPCASTING in selenium.

3rd Inheritance 
Inheritance 
We extends Base Class in each and every test class. we perform hierarchical inheritance in our framework like we have  Base class is super class we extend one super class into multiple sub classes i.e. Test classes. i.e. one super class is extends in multiple sub classes is called as hierarchical inheritance.
3. INHERITANCE
	We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files etc., in the Base Class.
	We extend the Base Class in Tests Class. that is nothing but Inheritance in Selenium Framework.

4th is Polymorphism
Combination of overloading and overriding is know as polymorphism.
One object showing different behaviour at different stages of life cycle.
1.	Compile time Polymorphism – method Overloading 
Method overloading means method having same name but different parameters is called as method overloading.
We use method Overloading on our Framework like 
When we use statement like driver.switchTo().frame(); this frame() accept three type of input like String, int, and WebElement. (so this is not possible that one method can accept multiple parameter, means the class in which frame methos is created in that class three method are created having same name but having different parameters. Like one method accept string parameter, one method accept int parameter  and one method accept WebElement. So this is also an example of method overloading.  Like this frame method accept string, WebElement and int also because in that class three method having same name is created method is available with different parameters.  i.e. same method name different parameter.
We can Create method overloading method in Utility class also.
2nd example is like our frame work we need multiple sheet data then data time we can cerate two method 1st method accept data from main sheet i.e. we only have to pass row index and cell index  and 2nd method we have to pass String sheetname, row index and cell index also like if we want fetch data from multiple sheet then every time we can change sheet name and we provide index value of row and cell then we can fetch data from any sheet.
	We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
	A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading.
	eg. driver.switchTo().frame(): - String name, int index, WebElement


2.	Run time Polymorphism – Method overriding 
In selenium architecture there are to method i.e. get() and navigate() this methods are present in WebDriver means that method are completed in Remote WebDriver implementation class then this method are extends in different – different browser classes in that browser classes definition of this methods are updated for each browser in each browser classes.
This are the method  are overridden in selenium architecture internally. i.e. get() and navigate() 
which are declared in WebDriver interface  then that method are completed in RemoteWebDriver implementation class and this class is extended in each browser class of this methods definition are updated / modified in each browser class as per browser requirement. So this are two overridden methods present in selenium architecture.
4. METHOD OVERRIDING
	Declaring a method in child class which is already present in the parent class is called Method Overriding. 
	Examples are get and navigate methods of different drivers in Selenium.

5th Encapsulation 
Encapsulation
Encapsulation means hiding data member of one class from another classes. (hiding data form other classes is called encapsulation.)
We use Encapsulation in each and every POM Class. every POM class is an example of encapsulation. 
In which we declare data member i.e. variable globally by using @FindBy Annotation and scope of data member is private.
Initialize within constructor by using pagaFacectory.initElements() and scope of constructor is public.
And we use that variable inside method having scope of method is public access specifier.
So in framework Each POM Class is example of encapsulation.
5. ENCAPSULATION
	All the POM classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, 
	we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
	Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.

	Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up code and data together in a single unit. It is used to hide the data of a class from another class. 
	Encapsulation can be achieved when you declare all variables as private and a public method in a class to get the values of the variable.

6th  Abstraction
Abstraction
Means hiding implementation of code from user and show only functionality to user. 
Means hiding actual code and provide  functionality is created by using that code. Like hiding actual code and give access to only functionality in other classes is called abstraction. 
In our framework when we are in POM class then it is example of encapsulation.
But  when we are in test class and cerate object of POM class in this case global variable present in POM class i.e. actual  WebElement  we can’t  access to  that Element  but can access the methods which are created by using that element we can access that method.
When we are test class and when we cerate object of POM in test class. then in POM class There is private variable is present i.e. WebElement  and public method. here we can’t access the WebElement but we can access to method.
Here we hide actual WebElement but we cam access the method which are created using this WebElement.
So this is called as Abstraction. Here we don’t have access to WebElement or xpath but can use method which is created by using that method for to perform actions.
When we are in POM class then it is encapsulation and When we are in test class and we cerate object of POM class then it called as Abstraction. 
OOPs concept in Selenium Framework

1. Interface: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	  In this statement WebDriver is nothing but interface in selenium.
TakesScreenshot,JavaScriptExecutor ,ItestResult, Webdriver,WebElement

2. UPCASTING: WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
	  above statement is nothing but UPCASTING in selenium.

3. INHERITANCE
	We create a Base Class in the Framework to initialize WebDriver interface, WebDriver waits, Property files etc., in the Base Class.
	We extend the Base Class in Tests Class. that is nothing but Inheritance in Selenium Framework.

POLYMORPHISM
	Combination of overloading and overriding is known as Polymorphism.

3. METHOD OVERLOADING
	We use implicit wait in Selenium. Implicit wait is an example of overloading. In Implicit wait we use different time stamps such as SECONDS, MINUTES, HOURS etc.,
	A class having multiple methods with same name but different parameters is called Method Overloading.
	eg. driver.switchTo().frame(): - String name, int index, WebElement

4. METHOD OVERRIDING
	Declaring a method in child class which is already present in the parent class is called Method Overriding. 
	Examples are get and navigate methods of different drivers in Selenium.

5. ENCAPSULATION
	All the POM classes in a framework are an example of Encapsulation. In POM classes, 
	we declare the data members using @FindBy and initialization of data members will be done using Constructor to utilize those in methods.
	Encapsulation is a mechanism of binding code and data together in a single unit.

	Encapsulation is the process of wrapping up code and data together in a single unit. It is used to hide the data of a class from another class. 
	Encapsulation can be achieved when you declare all variables as private and a public method in a class to get the values of the variable.

6. ABSTRACTION
	In Page Object Model design pattern, we write locators (such as id, name, xpath etc.,) in a Page Class. 
	We utilize these locators in pom class but we can’t see these locators in the tests. Literally we hide the locators from the tests.

	Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation of internal details and showing the functionality to the users.


Scroll function 
 Some time we have to perform scroll up and scroll down function. By using only Java and Selenium we cant perform scroll up and down operation. So by using JavaScript language we have to perform that scroll related operation.
When we want to run one code in JavaScript language then 
Step1 :
we have to perform down casting between WebDriver object and JavaScriptExecutor interface  (convert WebDriver into JavaScriptExecutor interface ).
((JavascriptExecutor)driver)
Step 2:
Then we have to call JavaScriptExecutor Interface method i.e. executeScript() method. then we have to pass String input to this executeScript() method i.e. “Window.scrollby(pixlevalue,pixlevalue)” 
		((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,1000)");

Here we pass string input to method then this input is sent to java script language then it perform scroll operation.
To run program in JavaScript language we have to 1st perform casting between JavaSriptExecutor interface and wbedriver object.  Then we have to call its method i.e. executeScript() then we pass String input to this method i.e. window.scrollBy(0,1000). Parameter which is give like 0 and 1000 here meaning of this means 
Scroll down (vertical)
 If we want to perform scroll down then we have to  pass 1st value 0 and 2nd value we have to pass positive pixel value we have to give pixel value how much we want to perform on that site. This values are measured in pixel how many pixel we perform scroll so 0 and 1000 are pixel value.
If we give positive value then it  perform scroll up and like 1st value is 0,1000 then it will perform scroll down operation. By 1000 pixel.
Scroll up: (vertical)
when we give 1st value 0 and 2nd value in negative then it will perform scroll up operation. 
((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.scrollBy(0,-300)");
Here when we run this program then it will open site then it will perform scroll down by 1000 pixel and then after it will perform scroll up by -300 pixel.
Here To perform scroll Up then we given 2nd parameter in negative and if we want perform scroll down then we give 2nd parameter positive pixel value. Like in scroll up and down we just have to change  2nd parameter.1st parameter is fix i.e. 0.
1st parameter is for scroll left and right.
We have to give  pixel value by seeing how much pixels is it scrolling then according to our requirement we can give pixel values.
This window.scrollBy this are the method of JavaScriptExecutor  so we are sending this input to JavaSriptExecutor. 
(here we are running this code in JavaScript language by using method i.e. executeScript() not in selenium java. This executeScript() method is method of JavaScriptExecutor interface. Here 1st we perform down casting then we call this method then we pass input to javaScriptExecutor then it will perform scroll operation i.e. string “window.scrollBy(0,1000) for scroll down and “window.scrollBy(0,-300)” for scroll up.)
method to scroll the document by a certain amount. The first argument (0) is the number of pixels to scroll horizontally, and the second argument (-300) is the number of pixels to scroll vertically. In this case, it will scroll the document up by 300 pixels. 

Scroll left or Right  (Horizontal)
If we want to perform scroll left or right then we have to change 1st parameter value and 2nd parameter value is always 0.
Right Scroll
Then we have to use same step and same method but we have to change 1st parameter value we have to give positive pixel value for to Perform right scroll operation.
((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.scrollBy(300,0)");
Left scroll 
If we want to perform left scroll then we have to give 1st parameter negative value.
		((JavascriptExecutor)driver).executeScript("window.scrollBy(300,0)");
This statement perform scroll left operation.
Scroll into View
Scroll up or down to particular WebElement.
In scroll into view it directly scroll to that particular WebElement. We don’t have to mention pixel values.
1st we have to identify the element from which we want to scroll.
WebElement AdChooise = m.findElement(By.xpath("//a[@class='_41ug']"));
Here we have to scroll to this particular element like this element is present on facebook login page but it is not visible for now but if will visible when we scroll down to this element.
Then we have to use scrollIntoView().
For now we store element into an object from which we want to scroll.
Now to scroll to that particular element
1st we have to convert WebDriver object into JavaScriptExecutor interface and then we have to call the method executeScript() then we have to pass two parameter 1st is String and 2nd is WebElement this String is constant we don’t have to make change in that i.e. “arguments[0].scrollIntoView();” so as we want to run it in java script language. 2nd parameter is WebElement.

	((JavascriptExecutor)m).executeScript("arguments[0].scrollIntoView();", AdChooise); // String, WebElement
When  we run this program then it will scroll to this element doesn’t matter where Element is right, left, up or down any where on web page it will scroll to that element. 

2nd approach is better like we have to find WebElement then we have to give String input and WebElement then it will automatically scroll to that particular WebElement.
(here we don’t have to mention the pixel).
Selenium Wait / synchronization 
In Selenium automation, it's essential to add waits in your test scripts to handle situations where the page load time might vary due to factors like internet speed or server response. Adding waits helps in synchronizing the speed of Selenium and the browser, ensuring that actions are performed only when the page is fully loaded and ready.
When we navigate from one page to another, sometimes the new page takes a bit of time to load completely. If Selenium performs actions before the page is fully loaded, it can lead to errors or inaccurate test results. To avoid this, we use synchronization techniques to make Selenium wait for the page to load before proceeding with the actions.
we have to match speed of selenium and browser then we have to make use of synchronization. 
 To perform synchronization we have three types of wait in selenium 
1st Implicit wait 
2nd explicitly wait 
3rd fluent wait 
Like we have to wait in java i.e. Thread.sleep(); like that same way we have to 3 types of wait available in selenium implicit, explicit and fluent wait.



Implicit wait 
We use implicit wait  whenever we are navigating from one page to another page, and  another page taking some time to load in that case we can use implicit wait. 
When we are navigating from page 1 to page 2 and page 2 taking some time get load in that case we can use implicit wait and we can perform synchronization.
We  have to mention this implicit wait only once when are opening browser initially. When we open browser at that same time we mention implicit wait only once and until browser get close till then this implicit wait is applicable. And when we are navigating from one page to next  page and 2nd page is get time to get load until page is get loaded then it will wait for some time as we mention in condition.
(like some time if we are navigating from one page to 2nd and due internet or some time take some time get load if we don’t mention implicit wait then selenium immediately action present on that page as page is not loaded then also selenium perform action that in that case selenium through error no such element present. But here element is present and it take some time to get  load).
For this reason we have to add implicit wait, because when first  time when we open URL 1st time in that case get()  or navigate().to() method take care / responsible that until URL get load properly /successfully it  restrict selenium to perform action on that page but once page get  loaded and we are navigating on other pages then we have to mention implicit wait. Here we mention implicit wait only once like 
driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(20));
here we provide time in second.  Like here we only give parameter i.e. (second) i.e.(20)
like here we mention 20 so selenium will wait for maximum 20 second from navigating one page to another if page is loaded in 2 second then  it will immediately  perform action on that  element (without waiting  for 18 sec) if page take more time we mention then it  fail that script.
But here  if we mention Thread.sleep(20000); then it  blindly wait for 20 second then it will perform action on that. It  check for page load or not nothing it wait for 20 sec and we have  to mention every time where we want to wait. but in case of implicit wait we have to mention only once then it applicable for until browser close. 
(like whenever we are navigating from one page to next then if page taking some time load then every time selenium will wait for to get page loaded then it will perform action on that.)
In implicit wait we give one parameter i.e. Time value In second i.e.(20);(if the page I loaded in given time it will perform action on that other wise if page not loaded in given time then it throws exception i.e. no such element.)
If applicable for Complete web page like page is properly / successful loaded until then it will wait (it will check that web page is completely loaded or not.)
1. Implicit wait: 
 Applicable: Complete webpage
 1 parameter: Time value (seconds)
Explicit wait 
Explicit wait and fluent wait check that single element present on page is loaded or not. it don’t check that entire webpage loaded or not.
: This wait allows us to wait for a specific condition to be true before proceeding with the action. It provides more control and flexibility over waiting conditions. We can use ExpectedConditions class in combination with the WebDriverWait class to implement explicit waits.
These wait are use to check that one of element present on web page is get loaded or not. like radio button is displayed or not, like radio  button is selected or not, like one of element is enable or not  like perform this type of operation we can use  explicit wait like single element is loaded in given  time or not.
Like if we want  to perform action on single element like one condition is satisfying/tre or not to ensure/check  that we use explicit wait / fluent wait.
Explicit wait is applicable for single element on web page like to check condition of single element it’s true or not that time we use explicit wait. like radio button is selected or not, check box is selected or not, one element is displayed or not like this we will check.
Like to verify that logo is present or not some time one of element take some it to get load so in that we can use explicit wait. like some time when we click on radio button then it will take some time register that click like it take 2-3 second then we can  wait, like one of element is enable or not  like to check conditional statement we use explicit or fluent wait like to check condition is true or not.
Explicit wait is applicable for element in web page.
We pass to parameter 1st is time in second like 10, etc 
2nd parameter is condition like isSelected, isdisplyed , isEnabled 
(like we have to check condition of one of element i.e. we click to radio button but we have to verify that click is registered/ is it clickable or not. like some it don’t get click within second then we give 2secodn time then we give condition like isselected for given time i.e. 2sec it will check that given condition is true or not if it taking more  time as compared to given time then script will failed at that point. But if click operation is performed  in given time then script will continue. (we can give more time also like 5sec and condition then we verify condition like every .5 sec it verify that condition is true or not if condition get true in 2 second then perform next operation don’t wait for entire time we mention but if condition is not true in given time then script will failed at that point)



Difference between implicit and explicit  wait  
Implicit wait  	Explicit wait 
Implicit wait applicable for entire web page 	Explicit wait applicable for single element in web page 
We have to mention Implicit wait only once when we open Browser at that time. So we have to call that implicit wait once then it will applicable Until browser get closed .
 like if we are navigating 10 pages then every time it will wait until page is get loaded. 	But explicit wait is valid for single element in webpage. for which element we call that wait it only applicable for single element.
We have to pass only one parameter i.e. time in second 	We have to pass two parameter i.e. time in second and condition to be checked. 

Fluent Wait
Fluent is a next part of explicit wait like in explicit   wait  we give some amount of time then we check  that if the condition is get true or not in give  time if condition get true in given time then script  will execution is continue but  condition is not  true in given time then at  that time explicit  wait will failed that script at that point. But some time anyhow we need condition true in this case (like we want   click on login but and we give 10 sec but button is click at 20 sec but we have to until button get click then we use fluent wait.)
Fluent wait is applicable for single element 
We have to pass three parameter 1st is Time value in seconds i.e.10,etc
2nd parameter is condition that need to be checked (isSelected, isDisplayed, isEnabled)
3rd parameter  is frequency its also time in  second i.e. 5,etc
Like  initially we mention time 10sec and we give one of condition like logo is displayed or present  or not then we apply frequency i.e. also time like we give 5 second.
So here in mention 10 second after every .5 seconds it will check that logo is present or not (like suppose if condition is satisfied in 2 sec then it will execute another operation) like some time we have face condition like in 10 second given condition is not satisfied then here it  don’t fail script  it will comes to frequency and wait for 5 sec once the 5 second completed then again comes to 1st parameter i.e. 10 second then again check for 1o second condition is true or not if condition is true in given time then it will execute another operation, if again condition is no true in 10 sec then it again come to 3rd parameter i.e. frequency i.e. 5 again it will take brake for 5 sec and again comes to 1st parameter i.e. time in second. Like this way this will travel  / go in loop until given condition becomes true. 
So this goes into infinite loop.  Like (we have to run for 10km but in one stroke it not possible so after completing very 1 km we will take break for some minute then again we start running.) here also it don’t check element non- stop here also it will check for 10 second and if element not found then it will take brake for 5 sec and again check condition. Once then condition is true then it will exit from loop. Once in while we need to use this fluent wait. 
Implicit wait 	Explicit wait  	Fluent wait  
We use implicit wait always when we are navigating from one page to next.	We use explicit wait when we have to wait for single element condition regarding that element become true we give 	When we have condition like we need that condition true then we use fluent wait.
We pass only one parameter i.e. time in milli seconds 	We pass two parameter  time and condition in case of explicit wait	We give 3 parameter i.e. time, condition and frequency ( suppose if we given time 10 sec if condition is not true in given time then it will goes to 3rd parameter and wait for 5 i.e. which  time we specify in at 3rd parameter then again it comes 1st parameter and  check condition this cycle continue until condition becomes true.)
Implicit wait is applicable for complete web page. Util browser close. To check that page is load completely or not.	Explicit wait is applicable for single element present on webpage. 	Fluent wait also applicable for single parameter present on web page. (if condition is not  true then it will go in infinite lop then we have to mention timeouts for that condition how much time we want to wait from this particular test case) 
Pollening Time 0.5 seconds.- when we give time in seconds then after every  0.5 second it will check page is loaded or not, element is loaded or not.

Synchronization: matching selenium test script speed with browser speed 

selenium wait:

1. Implicit wait: 
 Applicable: Complete webpage
 1 parameter: Time value (seconds)

2. Explicit wait:
   Applicable: Single element in a webpage
   1 parameter: Time value(seconds)
   2 parameter: Condition (isselected, isdisplayed, isenabled)

3. Fluent wait:
   Applicable: single element
   1 parameter: Time value(seconds)  --10 Sec
   2 parameter: Condition (isselected, isdisplayed, isenabled)
   3 frequency: time(time in sec)- 5 sec

Automation working 
Suppose sprint working is going on and we all are working in a sprint wise so now we want to implement automation in that project so 1st we have to perform manual testing some initial sprint like 4-5 sprint like 1st all module are tested by manual tester like smoke, functional and all testing is done by manual tester and once after some period of time once some test cases are get stabled then we can perform automation testing on that project. 
Like in starting of every project features are not stable in initial sprints, means after completing one sprint that features are get updated or modified, like suppose if we developed test script in 1st or 2nd sprint then we have to perform many modifications. That why we avoid to initiate automation from very beginning sprints. So here wait until manual team provide us stable features test cases.
Manual testing is begin from 1st sprint and once some 3-4 sprints are completed and once some features are get stabled then we start automation on that and in that also when manual test team give us some stable features for regression test cases we will start automating that test cases.
Stable means suppose in sprint 1 there are 10 test cases/ features  and in sprint 2, 5 test cases/ features  are new then in sprint 2 , then last 10 test cases are old test case and 5 test cases are new so here manual team will perform smoke, functional and non- functional on new features then old features also we have to in every sprint i.e. regression testing in manual testing and automation also.
So manual team will test new features 1st then they will test old features, in old features then in sprint 2 manual team found some test case are stable means no changes are to be seen that test cases then that test cases are stable like once 3-4 sprint are completed and manual test team found some stable features then  like they obverse that some test cases are stabled from sprint 1 to sprint 4 then that test cases are get separated by manual team  they prepare list of it and that stable test case are send for an automation. Then we start automation on that.
In early stage of project automation is start or until module get stable then also we can‘t perform automation on that.  Like if we perform on unstable test case then we have to perform many changes in that script. That’s why we start automation after once feature stable.
(in case of automation if the script is developed then we don’t have to perform many changes in that script. We have to developed new script so we don’t have time to modify old test scripts)
We only automate regression test cases. And that also when some features are stabled then we start automation by using regression test cases.
Like here we consider scenario like sprint 1,2,3 and 4 are completed so in this 3 sprint manual team preforming testing like new features and old features are tested by them like regression also.  like in sprint  4 on new features they perform smoke, functional, etc. and features which are developed in previous sprint they will perform regression testing on that. So we have to test old features also because while adding new functionality old features are working properly or not we have to ensure that then we can perform regression testing on that. 
So in sprint 4 manual team found/ observes that  some feature are stable or some list of test cases are stable and no changes are made in this test cases  then manual test engineer will short list that test cases and prepared that test cases in separate excel sheet. Then they manual test team lead mail to automation team lead like we found some features are stabled and now you can perform automation on that feature or you can create automation test script.
Mail: mail from manual test team lead  to automation Team lead for automation test script development. 
Then Automation test lead will forward that mail to automation team and he will conduct meeting in that meeting whole team will discuss that how many test cases are stable or not or  we can automate like is our framework is capable or not to automated or not  like  in automation there are some limitations like we cant automate captcha, bar code and otp. So we will review all test  case then we verify how many test cases we can automate then we separate that test cases and other test cases are get rejected.  Like suppose we get 50 test cases then 30 test case are approved for automation and 20 test cases are rejected.  Like  20 rejected test cases are forwarded to manual team they have test that test cases manually.
So in sprint 4 only development of automation test script on already developed framework. 
So we start development of test script means we convert manual test cases in test script or program by using POM, DDF, TestNG. Like we have to carte POM classes and Test cases. 
 Now team lead will distribute test cases to each team member.  Like suppose in our team we are 3 test engineer then out of 30 10-10 test cases are assign to each team member.
 
 Now each test engineer will start development of on test script and one time like 1st it will select test cases they check manually it working properly of or not some time if test case have to 10 step and we create script till 8th step and at 9th step there is captcha is present so we cant automate that  test cases so our whole day hard work is get waste and time also to avoid that we have to check that test case manually. Then we Create POM Classes for that test Case 
Roles in Development of Test Script.
1.	Creating POM Classes 
2.	Creating Test Classes 
3.	Preparing test data
4.	Creating common functions if required 
5.	Reviewing test script. 
Reviewing Test Script means once we create test Script then we reviewed that test script from seniors like to ensure that we are following framework rule correctly or not.  Like some time we can skip one of test then to ensure that kind of mistakes we have to reviewed our test scripts from our seniors member. Mostly senior member review the scripts. Like we develop all POM classes and Test Classes. Once we carte test class then we carte on separate suite for each Test class(having same name of test class) means every end of day once we carte test suite then we forward that test suite to our senior via mail Today I cerate this test script and added in this test suite then team lead will open that suit then it will review all POM class ,Test class  some time we don’t follow the naming convention, like  we don’t make use method which is previously carted but we don’t use that method and create separate method or like we  write code which is written in few line we added many line for that so we have to minimize that line of codes. Like we don’t mention test data properly like this type of mistakes can happen. So all this reviewed by senior member once reviewed is completed then we make list of comments then next day first we will perform modifications in script  according to comments then  again we forward for review then we start for to cerate new test script for another test cases.  Like this way we create test script each team have assign some different test cases. So each member create test suite of his name and test classes which is prepared by himself. 
So in sprint  4 where we initially start  automation so we only develop test script  we don’t perform any executions. Like we developed this script on our own laptops we run also on own laptop but actual test  script execution is not done on local pc it executed on execution  server created by company pc allocated for execution is called execution sever. 
(sprint duration is vary from company to company. Like two week, four week depending on that we are developing test scripts.)
When sprint 4 is at  its end then all test classes are added to main suite.
Like when development and review of all 3o test script is completed in sprint 4. So in this case
From Tomorrow new sprint is going to start an in that sprint we have to execute all test classes which we prepared in sprint 4(in automation if we developed test script in sprint 4 then we will execute that test script in next sprint and generate of that test then we pass that report to client.) like here a day before sprint started from tomorrow then today we will perform dry  run of all test classes. Dry run means we have to ensure that all test cases are properly working ( like in real life we do some  practice before match day or me make some rehearsal.)
Before main execution we run all test cases which we prepared  that all test script are working properly or not.
Main suite/ regression suite in which entire project test classes are added in that test suite.  Like as we created test suite for each team members then all their suite we create on test suite is called test suite.  So we will run that main suite before day of main execution to ensure that all things are working properly or not. For this reason we perform dry run if there are some modifications are needed then we will perform that before main execution. 
(so at  sprint 4 or sprint where we just started automation  in that sprint we just developed test  script.)

Once sprint 4 ends and sprint 5 started duration of sprint is 14 day i.e. 10 days like as an automation engineer in sprint 1st  50 % time  sprint we do execution and then 50% of time we develop new test scripts. Like 5 day we do execution means we execute main suite after execution of that we do analysis like if there are some error, if there are some bug then we raise that like we to do all of that like some many test cases are passed and how many of them are failed so all this things we have report .
Like 1st 50% time is allocated for execution we get sprint like client send mail to Project manager in mail it contain URL of new Sprint. Now that URL is forwarded to team member. Once we get sprint in execution will starts we 5 days for execution once we get sprint form client then team lead will call meeting for to decide planning of execution in that meeting it will decide that how many team member will involved in execution like to analysis of execution (like how many test cases are passed and how many of them  fail and reasons etc. and we have to prepare report in excel sheet how many of them is pass, failed, reason of failure and if there is bug then we have to mention that like this report we have to parped in  excel sheet.) and how  many team member will developed new test scripts. Like team lead will divide task of execution and development of test script.

Like 1st round of execution is completed like we run 30 test cases in which 
 
 20 test cases are passed and 10 fail as ten are failed then we have to analysis that  In that we have mention result of failure also like 5 are bugs and 5 are script error. Script error means if we provide wrong input, like one of locator is change or we provide wrong input to method, dynamic xpath is there then at time we can found script error. Like we fix script error then we rerun that test suite by using failed.xml file.
  In 2nd round of execution after fixing script error we observe that out of 5, 2 are pass and again 3 are fail.  Then we have combined result of both execution 22 pass and 8 are fail. This is report of sprint 4 only have report of automation test cases. 
So by this way execution is carried out. Once project progress is going onward size of test suite is increasing.
 
Here we update bug and error in Excel sheet. 
We have to maintain this type of error.
We  also involve in JIRA also in JIRA.  We can raise bug, track bug , we can cerate task, we can create epic, comments , we can write test cases we can import test cases.  Task is used log the time on that day which task we completed. We can update our daily task in task issue present in JIRA. Like by using  Task we can track our work and time where  we invested time on that  particular day. While working in company whole day which task we complete on that so end of day we can log / note our today work progress in Task. 
We cerate task by using JIRA while creating task we have to give summary i.e. tile  like what we do on that day like development of Test script (name of test script ) or execution of test suite, in comments we can mention in brief what we done. Task id is also  created while we crate that task.
So every day  at end of day we cerate task like what we done on that day.( we give heading and in comment we also mention the progress also who much work is done like that ).
Like 1st day we execute main suite then we mention it in comment, then 2nd we analysis the reports like how many pass 20 and how many are fail like 10 then we analysis 5 are bug and 5 are script error then we fix script error on 3rd we execute 2nd round of execution in that we observe 2 test cases are pass 3 are failed then now we have 22 pass test cases and 8 fail like this type of task we mention in task.  Every day in end of day by doing we can tack our work prosses and time also. like if team lead ask what on done on this particular day then we can refer this tickets i.e. Task by which we can easily show what we done on that day.
Task creation 
We can store all that day task in task like extend report result, excel sheet report , log file we can store in this task.
Then we share this task id to team lead and client then they can track our work like how much work is done. 
(like we are in sprint 20 and we want to see task in created in sprint 4 then we can easily see what we have do in sprint 4 by searching task id.)
(like suppose we are in sprint 7 and I do the execution sprint 5 and on that day I was on leave then I  share that sprint task id with team lead then we will see all the report if all ok then he will pass that id to client so client can get all report’s as we mention all reports in task.)  by using task we can track the work progress easily. That why task creating is very important. We have to maintain task for each day what I done on that day. 
We can carte task and in that we can add team lead in to watcher.
As if we found 8 bugs in automation so before raising that bug we will confirm with manual team that is same bug is already raised or not as all test cases are executed by manual team. There are chances that out of 8, 2 bugs are already raised then there is no need to raise that bug again we get  bug  id of that bugs. And 6 six bug are new. So we will raised that bug. Then we link all 8 bug  id in task.  As we added bug’s in task then it also contain URL of that bug also by click on that we can direct navigate to that bug. Combine one report will store within task.
For each execution we create task and we stored all reports of that execution in  that task like bug id, excel report, extent report etc.

Execution of main Test suite 

1.	Execution of test suite 
2.	Analysis of test cases we do analysis after execution 
3.	Updating and publishing report on JIRA  and mail also 
4.	Creating JIRA Task 
5.	Creating a JIRA Ticket for failed test cases for raising bug
6.	Modifying existing test script like if there is script error.
7.	Daily call with team lead/ reporting manger whether we are in development of test script or execution (we have call daily call with team  lead for to track status like what is did yesterday? What I am going to do day ?  and is there any difficulties/ road blocker? We will mention. If there are some difficulties then we discuss in this call. Like we are developing test scripts but input is not available then we have to develop that test case or that or if there blocker how to eliminate that we have to discuss here. And if any one have suggestions then he will give that suggestion.
Once the execution is completed then we start working on new development like 50 % part in sprint done and 50% time and part is reaming in that time we start development of new scripts. Like manual team will again give bunch of test cases to automate then  again we analysis that test cases and approve test cases for automation which can be automated.
Like if we get 70 test cases then 60 approved then 10 are rejected then 20 -20 test cases are assign to each team member again we have to develop test scripts and once reviewed is completed then we add that test cases in main suit. 
In cases of development also we cerate task how many completed and how many are reaming.to track progress we use task.
Now we have to 30 test cases already in main test suite and we added 60 test cases in sprint 5 now main suit have 90 test cases. 
Development and execution of sprint 5 is completed. 
Now a day before sprint 6 is going to start then we do dry run of main suite that all test cases are working properly or not. 
Like in sprint 6 also  same 50% time for execution and 50 % time for execution. Like out of 90, 70 pass 10 are bug and 10 are script error then we fix that script error and we again rerun that test cases by using failed test cases.  
App use in Companies:
1.	For mail – Outlook is used 
2.	For internal communication
1.	MS- team 
2.	Skype 
3.	Slack 
In this app we can make audio calling , video calling and screen share.
Leaves in companies 
1.	Sick leaves – 7
Like we have some health issue then we can use sick leave on that day.  In case of sick leave we don’t inform in advance. Like on same day we can mail/ call/message to manger  that I need leave today.
2.	Casual leave -7 (Apply before 1 week)
Casual leave means we have to go on leave on one of day then in the case of casual leave we have to inform before 3-4 day’s or a week we have to inform to manger. To take casual leave we have to inform week before taking leave. If we have important task on that day then that task is assign to other team member.
3.	Privilege leave – 22 (Apply before 2-3 week)
When we want long holiday like week in that case we ahe to inform at least 2-3 week before privileged leave (PL).As we are going on long holiday then we have to inform in advanced like before month  to mange work load.
4.	paternity leave for men 1 week  -2 week 


After joining Any 
After joining any company 1st 3 months or 6 month we have probation period after that we can convert to Parment.
Companies
1.	Product base company – best 
2.	Service base company 
Two types of call offer 
1.On roll – best 
Means working company and salary paying company.
2.  Of roll ( 3rd party or contract to hire)
Like suppose one company is working for another company and salary paying company is different. Like we are working in IBM and IBM have client Vodafone so IBM schedule our interview with Vodafone then vod. Conduct interview then we work for Vodafone but we are getting our salary from IBM like Vodafone pay to IBM and then IBM pay to us.   So Here company is IBM and Vodafone is client. (contract base jobs are not secured).


Automations life cycle 
Steps involve in automations?
When we perform automations there are some steps involved like 
Suppose if we want to implement automations in project then
1st point is
1.Define scope of Automations 
How many percent we are performing automation?
(suppose if we are added in project then and we want to  implement automation in that then what will be  your approach ?) here we have to define how many percent we are implementing automation in that project. Like we can apply automation like depending on how many stable features are available in our project depends on that we can add that feature in to automation script.
Like we find 30-40 percent module are stable then we can define that 40 % is possible in this project.
2. selecting correct automation Tool/ framework
Like we have to select the automation tool and framework to automate the scripts. Like selenium, TestNG, Maven, DDF etc. (It’s done by framework developer)
3.	Script development
Like after defining scope of automation and selecting   correct automation tool then script development will start.
Like we get some manual test case then we have to convert  that test cases into test script.
4.	Script execution 
After test script development in a next  sprint we start execution of test script. Like all the test cases which we prepared we will execute that test script. Then script  development and script execution when all test script are converted then we only involve in maintenance like we only execute that developed test scripts and only publish the reports.
5.	Script maintenance
Like after all development of test scripts is completed then we only involve in maintenance.(like mostly in service base company we have to give maintenance to client after whole project is complete then we have to give maintenance support to client.)like  we only  perform script  modifications if need but we don’t create any new script only execute  old test script and publish reports of execution.
(in maintenance only one test engineer is enough to maintain the code because no new development is going in that just we have to do some modifications is need so one test  engineer is enough)
1.	Define Scope of Automation: Determine the percentage of the project that will be automated. Identify stable and repeatable test cases suitable for automation. Set clear goals and objectives for automation.
2.	Select the Automation Tool/Framework: Choose the appropriate automation tool and framework based on project requirements, technology stack, and team expertise. Popular automation tools include Selenium, TestNG, JUnit, etc., and frameworks like Data-Driven Framework (DDF), Page Object Model (POM), etc.
3.	Script Development: Develop test scripts using the selected automation tool and framework. Convert manual test cases into automated scripts. Implement best practices and maintain code reusability.
4.	Script Execution: Execute the developed test scripts on the application under test (AUT). Observe the test results and identify any defects or issues. Automation tests should run reliably and consistently.
5.	Script Maintenance: Regularly maintain the test scripts to keep them up-to-date with changes in the application. Update scripts whenever there are changes in the AUT or new test scenarios to be added.
6.	Continuous Integration (CI) and Reporting: Integrate automation scripts with CI tools like Jenkins to execute tests automatically on code changes. Generate comprehensive test reports to monitor test execution results.
7.	Regression Testing: Use automation for regression testing to ensure that new code changes do not break existing functionality.
8.	Parallel and Cross-Browser Testing: Leverage automation to perform parallel testing on multiple browsers and devices to increase test coverage.
9.	Performance and Load Testing: Use automation tools to simulate heavy user traffic and evaluate application performance under different load conditions.
10.	Maintenance and Enhancements: Continuously enhance and improve the automation framework to adapt to changing project requirements and technology advancements.

--Automation Life Cycle/Steps involved in automation----

1. Define scope of automation
2. Selecting correct automation tool/Framework
3. Script Development
4. Script Execution
5. Script Maintenance
The condition Where we cant use automate in Agile
1.	When after completing sprint many changes request are made by stakeholder (like after completing 4-5 sprint every time client   made  change requests  after every sprint) like we as we  developed test script and in next sprint stakeholder made change request then we after every sprint we have to modify all previous test script. In this case we can’t implement automation because In Automation if we develop script  then it difficult modify every test script again and again.(we can  modify 3-4 test scripts out of 100 or we have to do some minor changes in 10-20 it also ok ) but we developed 10 test script and we have to modify 7-8  test script then in this cases we can’t implement automation.
When in agile there are too many changes request are made by client implementation of automation is not possible.
---The conditions where we can’t use automation in agile ---
  1. When agile testing always asks for changes or stack holder changes in requirements.
(like we are selecting Tool for Automation Why we are selecting Selenium over other tools present in market.)
Primary Feature’s Of good automation tool
While selecting automation tool which things need to be consider?
1.	Test environment support & easy to use 
Automation tool must support to Test environment which we setup for preforming testing. Tool must be easy to use.
2.	Tool must have good debugging facility
Tool must have to good debugging facility. Like when one of test script is failed then reason of failure should be shown by that tool. Like when we use TestNG with integration of selenium then we add failure message like when script is failed then we see user generated and system generated messages. By reading that messages we can easily identify why this test script is failed.
3.	Robust Object/ locator identification
Like we have to select tool for which we can easily select locators/xpath  for that tool.
The tool should provide robust mechanisms for identifying web elements on the application's user interface. This ensures that locators selected for web elements are stable and reliable.
4.	Tool must support multiple Framework
We have to choose tool which can integrate with multiple framework, like With maven, DDF,  TestNG. Like tool must be integrated with supporting framework. This is all feature of good automation Tool. Like selenium because it have all features. This flexibility allows testers to choose the framework that best suits their testing requirements.
While selecting automation tool we have to consider all above things.
----Primary features of good automation tool----
1. Test environment support & easy to use
2. Good debugging facility
3. Robust object/locator identification
4. Supports multiple frameworks
Step involved in In Planning phase of Automation
Which things we have to consider while planning  of automation?
1.	Selecting right automation tool.
We have to select correct automation tool 
2.	Selecting Automation Framework if Any 
Then we have select which framework is useful then we have to select correct framework.
Determine whether an automation framework is needed to organize and manage test scripts effectively. Choose the framework that aligns with the project's objectives and test requirement
3.	 List of scope for Automation Test Environment
Like we should have  list of test case which are converting into test scripts or how many % we are implementing in project, how many test engineer, (like if we need some extra test engineer then we inform to HR then they will hire for new test Engineer)( like when we get count like monthly we have to develop this number of test scripts then we have to figure out that is we have enough team member to fulfil that requirement if not then we have to hire some test engineer we have to decide that.
Define the scope of automation by identifying which test cases will be automated and the percentage of automation coverage in the project. Plan for the required number of test engineers based on the workload.
4.	Papering Grant chart for development and Execution 
We have to prepare chart like to know the monthly target, like how many test script we have develop and how much time it will take to execute that. Like calculating this all thing we have to give time estimation to team lead.
Create a Gantt chart or project timeline that a general description the development and execution schedule. This chart helps in estimating the time required for script development and execution, providing a clear view of the project's progress.
5.	Identify the test Deliverable
Like we have to give time estimation for development and execution of test script. We have to specify the approximate time for development and execution. (like this much time is needed for development and this much time is needed for execution).
Determine the deliverables for the automation testing phase, such as the number of test scripts to be developed and the expected time for development and execution. This helps in setting realistic targets and managing the project effectively.
Steps Involved In Planning Phase Of Automation 
1. Selecting the Right Automation Tool 
2. Selecting Automation Framework If Any
3. List of Scope for Automation Test Environment
4. Preparing Grant Chart for Dev. And Executions 
5. Identify the Test Deliverables
Total number of module in a project?
How many module is present in project/application? (10-15 any number)
11 modules are present in our project.
(if any one ask then we have to given answers in range of 10-15. Modules means feature like we WhatsApp  then features of WhatsApp  is chat, status, payment, setting, profile , audio calling, video calling,etc.) like this our project also consists of number of module.
Total number of Web pages / POM Classes in Project ?
How many Web pages / pom classes are present in project/ application? (150-250)
When I check last time then 210 POM Classes/web pages are present in project.

Here we create POM class for each web page, so number of POM classes are depends on number of Web Pages are available in application.( some time if new web page is added then initially we don’t have POM classes for that new web page we have  to wait until that web page get stable then we add that into automation then we cerate POM classes for that new web page also so we consist of 90% POM classes available in project some features are new so it will take time get added into automation.)  web pages are ranging between 150 -250. Because in Realtime many web pages are present. Like when we click on one of page then  new web page is open like from one page to 2, 2 to 3 web page’s created. Many web pages are present in real time.
Test Classes In project 
How many test classes are present in project?
290 Test classes are present in our Project.
As we consider we have  210 POM classes.  As we know to  run multiple POM classes we have one test class. like to design test script we create test class.   for now we have  210 POM classes then we ahe 290 test classes ( Test classes are vary Between 150- 350) ( there is no directly relation is present between Test classes and POM classes. It possible that one POM class is used in 100 Test cases and one of POM class is used only one test case. So there is no directly relation between POM classes and Test classes.) POM classes are repeatedly used use in multiple test classes. (from given   POM classes many Test Classes are created depending of there functionality)
Total number of test script in each test class?
How many test cases or Test script in each test class?
On an Average test class contains 5 Test script in one test class.


 Like  we have 290 Test classes in project.  In Each Test class it contains multiple test cases like some test class contains 2 test cases 0r some test class contains 5 test cases( in vary from 2 to 10 test cases in one Test class). in each test class we are design 5 test cases in each test class. ( in real time test class contain 4-5 test cases in on test class but if test cases is lengthy at that time test class contains only test case or if some test class contains 10 test cases also if length of test case is short.) in average Test class contains 5 test cases/ test script.
Total number of Test scripts in project 
How many test scripts/ test cases are present in project?
When I check last time / sprint  then 1450 test cases or test scripts are present in our project currently.
Like  we have 290 test classes and each test class contain 5 test script then 1450 test scripts are present. If any one ask how many test scripts are present in current project. Then we have to give answers in between 800 to 2500 test scripts are present.(Approx. count we have to give).
How many sprints are completed? 
We have 14day sprint then 40 sprints are completed.
1 features= 1 module =  TC in each module 130 --> 50 to 250
1 feature is considered as one module and in  one module how many test cases are prepared on one module so  it depends of size and  complexity to module.  Like  if module is  small  then 50 test cases are prepare but if module is big  or complex then  250 test cases are also from.
But on an average 130-140 test cases are in each module.
Test scripts  per day 
How many test scripts are developed per day?
So  it totally depends on complexity of  test script.
 If test  script is simple then we can  develop 3-4. If test  script is complex means to  many test steps are available then in that case one test script  also difficult to develop. Some time all POM classes are ready then we have to  only develop test classes then in that case 5-6 test  script are develop.  But  some time POM classes are also not   available then we ahe to  develop that and test scripts also then it will take so. Its depends on complexity of test script. On and average 1 to 4 test scripts are developed but  average 2 test scripts  are develop. 
Test scripts in month / 14 day sprint 
How many test script are prepare monthly?
If we consider monthly  sprint then out of 30 day 20 days are working  because 8 are holiday and two day are some other activities. In that 1st 10 day execution and then 10 day development so 10 day of development and per day  2 test scripts means 20 test script are developed monthly. (15-25 test scripts are developed monthly).

Total modules in a project: -- 10--------->10 to 15 
Total Webpage/pom classes in project: 200    -->150 to 250  
Test classes in project   :  300   : 150 to 350 
Test cases/script in each Test class: 5       2 to 10
Total no of test script in project: 1500    800 to 2500  test scripts in project

1 features= 1 module =  TC in each module 130 --> 50 to 250

Test script per day:       depends on complexity of Test script (1 to 4) (avg 2)
test script per month (20 working days--> 10 days devp):  avg (20 )   15 to 25

GitHub 
GitHub is used to store the source code.
The code which we developed on daily base on our local machine. On our personal pc by using IDE. So at the end of day every day code which prepare we store that code at central location i.e. GitHub repository. 
Repository means central location where we store the information is called repository. We are using GitHub repository to.

Like suppose in our project we have 3 test engineer in our project.  Like TE1, TE2 and TE3.  And all test engineers are working on there own personal IDE in project explorer. means they are working on local machine. machines where we work on. So at the end of day all test engineers will store all code which they prepare on their local machine to the central location i.e. GitHub repository. Is called as central repository or remote repository.
So we store code on code on GitHub but directly we can store code on  GitHub from our local machine to central repository.  
Local repository 
 So to store code at Central repository we have to make  use  of software i.e. git / git repository. So first we have to move code from local machine to git software i.e. this software is called as local repository.
So  here 1st we have move code from local machine to local repository.  
Commit process
The process by which we move code from local machine to local repository is called commit/ code commit.
Once the task complete at end of day every test engineers will move their code from local machine to local  repository i.e. IDE to Git software. By using commit.
Then that code is moved to the central repository i.e. GitHub repository  is called as PUSH.
Push
The process by which we transfer code from local repository to central repository i.e. git repository (software) to GitHub is called as push or code Push.  
(push like upload).
Here  we push code from local repository to central repository i.e. git to GitHub.

here we write code on local machine and at the end of day  we commit that code to local repository i.e. git  then we  push that code to central repository i.e. GitHub  now code is store in GitHub repository.   Combined code is present at central location.
 On next day when we start working then we have to download that code then we get code of all team which uploaded by all.  Advantage of this code which we prepare yesterday that code is access by other team member or we can access or use code which is developed by other  team member.
 Because this we can make reuse of the code. (like in our laptop the code which we prepare yesterday is present there but along with that we have get code which is developed by our team members also.(because when we upload code to repository then it is copy of code) like we can reused the code which is developed by team our team also can reuse the code which developed. That why at end of day we  upload our code on GitHub so team can use that code and doing this we can make reuse of code.
So on next day morning we download the updated code by team member and we can reuse that code.
 So we can’t directly download Code from GitHub to local machine 1s we have to download from GitHub to Git then we have  to import that code into local machine. 
Pull/ clone 
Process by which we can download code from Central repository to local repository i.e. GitHub to Git is called as pull/ code clone.
Import 
 Once the code downloaded in to  git  then we  import that code in to local machine.
(here  we can import that code and make reuse of code or start working on that.)
 

On daily basis we do all this task like every day we have to store/commit  all code in git  software then we have Push that code from git to GitHub and on every day at starting we have to Pull that code from GitHub to git then we have to import that code on our local machine i.e. IDE.
 When we import code then we get updated code of all team member.

All GitHub setup is done by Framework developer or Team lead.
Steps to create repository in GitHub server
1.	Create a project in Eclipse/ IDE 
He will cerate project on local machine initially. So in that Project all Base class and Utility class and configuration is done by framework developer.
(to push code on GitHub  we have to create a account to GitHub)
2.	Create Account on GitHub 
We can store project on GitHub. (some time we get assignment from interviewer we have to complete that assignment and we have to push that code on GitHub and we have to share the link of that GitHub repository) 
Here we get user name and password of GitHub account.
3.	Create repository in GitHub
On One GitHub Account we can create multiple repository.
Repository: we create one repository for one project. To store the data of one project we create one repository. (if we are working parallelly on four project then we have to cerate 4 repositories).
 There are two ways to cerate repository
1.	We have create repository option by  clicking on that we can cerate repository
2.	 
3.	Or we can cerate repository by clicking on + sign near profile 
 

We can give same  project and repository by which we can identify easily.
While creating repository then we see two option public and private. In public any one can see or access that repository.
In private we can manage we can access or see that repository. In company private repository is created.
On left hand side we can see repository is created in our account.
 
When we click on that  then we get Unique URL for Each repository.
https://github.com/SauravKasture/PlanetsSuperHeros.git
 

 Here  we can share this URL to access our code.  We can cerate n-number of repository.
We have to save our URL to PUSH or PULL code.
When we PUSH or PULL code then instead of password We Have to use Token.
1st we have to generate Token. Every account get Token. 
Token is Applicable for Overall Account.
  To generate token.
1.	Click on  profile 
2.	Then settings 
3.	Then developer setting   at bottom
 
4.	Then click on Personal Access Token 
5.	Classic Token 
6.	Click on Generate New token 
7.	 
8.	Click on new Token (classic)
 
9.	Then we have to  give Name to Token this name can be any thing. 
10.	Then we can mention the token expiration also.  after time period is finish then token automatically get expires.
 
13.	Select 1st option repo 
 
14.	Click on generate token button.  Token will be created.
15.	Then token is generated.  We have to copy that token for further reference.
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
when we perform Code Pull or Code PUSH then We have to use this token instead of password.
 
 
Push request
Step 1:create local repository (.git)
This local repository is present on our local laptop. 
Like we have to cerate repository name and same project name should same. 
To carte local repository for project then 
1st we have to right click on project name then 
2nd click on Team 
 
3rd shared project 
Then we have to click two check boxes then we have to click on cerate repository.
 
Click on finish. 
Then local repository git will get created.
Step2: Open local repository (git) window 
Now we have to open window of local repository git window.
1st For to open that we have to click on quick access 
2nd then search “git repositories”  git repositories (git)
We see one option in eclipse in top right corner i.e. quick access.
 
Then  search window get open then search for
 
Then click on that then window will open in left side below project selection. 
 
Here we see all local  repositories.  This local repository git.
This local repository git  is present in eclipse 

Step3: Commit source code from local machine to ( project  explorer ) to local repository git.
here we commit code from local machine i.e. project  to local repository git.
1st right click on project which we want to commit.
2nd click on team 
3rd click on Add to index 
 

4th then again right click on project 
5th click on Team then click on commit 
 
Then commit window will get open 

 
Here in commit window we have to add message to identify that which team member cerate this code. Because every day all team member will added there code here is it easy to identify which code is cerate by which team member.
Like here we give our name and description while committing 
[Saurav]: 1st changes in code.
6th click on commit button 
The commit process will completed. 
For now local machine code is committed to local repository git.
Step 4:  push source code form local repository (git) to remote repository (GitHub)
Now we have to push code form local repository to remote repository GitHub.
Like to  Push code we need URL of Repository, Token and user name. 
Then 1st right click on project name 
2nd click on team 
3rd click on Remote
4th then click on push 
 

Then following window will get open 
 
Then we have to enter repository URL, User name of git Hub , and Token instead of password.
 
6th Click to next button
7th then select Master form source ref
8th then select Add Specification
 
9th click on finish button.
Code is push to the GitHub
 

By this way frame work developer will  Push his code to server then all team member will access that code and poll that form remote repository to local machine. 
Like suppose to update project in his IDE and again commit that updated code to local repository then he will push that code to remote repository.
 
Here it show time and modified code also. 
For now framework developer work is done so he well call meeting to inform team that development of framework is completed you can start working it.

GitHub Repository

UN: PritiAndole
pwd: PritiA@95 / 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
URL: https://github.com/PritiAndole/3rdSeptA_github.git

1 github acc--> multiple repository
		1 repository--> multiple branches (Master)

1 project =1 repository

Steps to create repository in github server

1. Create a project in eclipse
2. Create acc in github
3. Create repository in github

Step1: Create local Repository(git)
right click on project-->Team-->Share project--select checkbox
-->select checkbox-->Create repository-->Finish


Step2: Open local repository(git) window
click on quick access-->search "git repositories" --> git repositories(git)


Step3: Commit source code from local machine(project/package explorer) to local repository(git)
right click on project-->Team-->Add to index-->
right click on project-->Team-->Commit--->add commit message-->commit  


Step4: push source code from local repository(git) to remote repository(bitbucket/github)
right click on project-->Team-->remote-->push-->Enter URL--> Enter UN & PWD(Token)
-->next-->source ref-->master-->add Specification-->finish


Step5 :pull/Clone repository
	open git repository window--> clone a git repository--> 
	Enter repository URL,UN & Pwd--> Next-->select branch &  Next--> Finish

Step6: Move Project from local repo to local machin(project explorer/working directory) (import project)
File-->import-->Git-->Project from git-->Existing local repo-->select project-->Finish
Step5 :pull/Clone repository
	open git repository window--> clone a git repository--> 
	Enter repository URL,UN & Pwd--> Next-->select branch &  Next--> Finish

Step6: Move Project from local repo to local machin(project explorer/working directory) (import project)
File-->import-->Git-->Project from git-->Existing local repo-->select project-->Finish

Step 5: pull /clone repository
To pull git repository 1s we have to open local repository i.e. git repositories
 
Then we have to click o n clone repository option
 
 
Then we have to add Repository URL which is given by team lead then User name of given by team lead, and then we have to add token which is created/  given by team lead by team lead.
 
Then we have to select branch i.e. master where all modified code is stored 
 
Then new repository is stored on our local location one folder will get created in our laptop.
 
Here repository is added in our local repository git
 
Now we have to import this code from local repository to local machine or project explorer
For that 1st we have to click on, file then click on import 
 
Then click on git expand that option then we have to select project from git 
 
Then we have to select source i.e. Existing local repository
 
Then we see all local repositories present then click on repository which we want to import 
 

Then we see importing option click on import existing project 
 
Click on next 
 
Project then added into our local repository 
 
Then we can do modification and then we have to gain commit that code to than repository.
Then new code is added in to repository.
What is code conflict?
(like suppose if we take example of bus if we are travelling from Pune to Mumbai and we are trying to book ticket of travels but due to some network issue we are not able to book ticket online and we book tick offline and we get set no52 and person also book tick online he also get tick of same set number 50 then now two person having same seat number ticket  so here confusion will from whom that seat is book. So we called this as conflict. Then we have to find solution of this confusion.)
Confit means while Push and polling like for same line two members are pushing code for same line then code conflict will occur. Like suppose in one class on one particular line two different person trying push different code then code confusion will occur.
A code conflict in GitHub occurs when two or more branches have made changes to the same lines of a file and Git is unable to automatically merge the changes. This requires manual resolution by the developer to determine which changes should be kept and which should be discarded.
GitHub code conflict is a problem that occurs when two or more people make changes to the same file, and Git can't combine the changes automatically.
Suppose we in Utility class we 100 line code is present already and we download that code and other team member also download that code, now both are working on different location, both member don’t have idea that both are working on same file or same class. now both are working on same class and both are creating some reanimate method, like test eng1 also working on Utility class and test eng2 also working on same class at  same time. Like already 100 line code is present and Te1 also created code in between 101-105 and TE2 also create some code in between 101-105. But end of the day both are pushing there code to Git Repository at same time. Like when test1 try to push his code then his code updated to GitHub, but when Test Eng2 try push his code then git hub get confused like already on that line some code is present and then at time previous code will get discarded or it merge two code with one then confusion will get occur. 
conflict means:  in same file / class on same number of line two team member try to push code then it is called as code  conflict/confusion.
(if both team member have some idea about like both are working on same file then mutually find some solution, but both don’t have idea that both are working on same class that why conflict is occurring) like on same line its not possible to store code of different type then code conflict will occur. Like mering is not possible properly like if we merge code then 1st member code will get discarded or it will combine two different codes in one then again confusion will get increase. Or some time we can lose one team member code.)
(both team member created different file/ class then confusion will not occur but both are working on same file and same lines then code conflict will occur.)
This code conflict will occur only once.
So to overcome this conflict We have to find solution for that. 
Solution of this like on one GitHub account we can cerate multiple repositories.
In a same repository we can create multiple branches also. And by default in contain one branch that is master branch. Like in class there multiple methods are available but there one important method i.e. main method. like same way in one repository many branches are present/ we can create  but by default only master  branch present. 

Solution for to overcome the conflict is, 
Like team lead will create two more branches for each team member like in our team we consider we are 2TE then, TL will cerate 2 branches one for each. Like he will give branch name same as team member name. 
Master is pre-defined branch. (in build branch ) but team lead will create two  more branches like we have two TE i.e. Saurav and Ryuk then team lead will create two branches and give name Saurav and Ryuk. This two new branches are called as user defined branch. 
Now while pushing code or pooling code we see three branches 1st master, 2nd saurav and 3rd is Ryuk. While polling also we see all 3 branches. Like on which barnche we select then it will download that repository code in our local repository then we can import it into local pc.
By doing this we over come code conflict like, like while pushing code we don’t have to push code in master branch we have to push our code in our name branch. Like suppose code is created by saurav then he will push code in Saurav branch  and code is created by Ryuk then he will push that code in Ryuk branch. In real time no one push code in master all push there code in there name branch. 
When code is push by TE then team lead will get notifications like in this particular branch code is push by team member. That notification is called as poll request.(also called as PR).
When we push code to our branch then notification if send that by this member in this repository code is pushed.
Then all team member will push there code on there respective branch. 
Then poll request is send to Team lead from Saurav and Ryuk. (end of day both team member will add/push there code in there branches team lead get notification also )
Now team lead will review team member code.
(is code review is not that which we see in Automation working. here it only check that both team member code are different or both code having common file this only check by team lead.)
Scenario number 1:
Like TL reviewing code he observed both team members files are different,(like both work on different pom classes) so there is no confusion there. So we called it as no conflict.
Then team lead move code of  Saurav and Ryuk code in master branch.(here TL will only check that file of both test eng. Are different.)
Scenario 2 : (code correction)
Like both Test engineer are working on same file or class, where there is possibility code conflict. 
Like both TE push there code in there branches then TL will receive notification, then team lead will review that like both TE create three files/ class, two files are separate file, but one file is common in between them so this code correction then team lead 1st move separate file of both test engineer in Master but the file which common like in class both test engi. Created code in between 100-110 line then he will move 1st test engineer code to master branch, and he will give reply to 2nd TE for code change, in this case test engineer will move his code from that line stored in separate file then he will poll latest code so in that code TE1 code is present  on that 100-110 line then TE2 will update his code after that line which is empty after 1st TE code then he also push his code in his branch then team lead will get notification, then he will merger this code in to master.
By this way like using branches we eliminate the possibility of code conflict. So, in one file we are storing both team member code.
(like when we have to download code then we have to download that code from master and when we have to upload then we have to upload that code in to separate branches.)
updated code will present in master branch.
How you tackled code conflict in your organization?
like in our organization separate branches are created for each team member then team lead will review that code if there is common file present then one code he will move in master branch and he will replay to other team member for code change then 2nd team member will download the latest code form master and update his code in that code.
Form master branch every day we will download updated code from that and we push our daily codes in our separate branches. Then team will review that code and merge that code into master. 
(We can use CMD command also to create repositories and Push and poll request we can perform by using CMD commands. But we do it by using eclipse).
GitHub 
 GitHub is web based version control system repository use for miniating source code that uses either mercurial or git. It also VCS tool which maintain code over the server.  It is Web Base VSC i.e. version control tool which maintain code at one location or server. 

Version control system (VCS)
Version control system means it is system that track changes make to digital assets over time.
Any digital asset (eg. File, image, video) entity that can be change over time can be tracked using VCS. (like any file changes/modification  are done in IDE or pc to track that changes we use VCS)
VCS is used to track any new code is created in IDE or modify any code it will identify that new changes, then we commit that code, this identification is done by git i.e. local repository present in our pc. Git is version control system. It will track/ identify the code changes and modification done in IDE. Then that code we will Push. Git software is used to identify all the code which created and modify.
Top version control tool
1.	Git
2.	CVS
3.	SVN
4.	Assembled
5.	Mercurial
6.	Bazaar
Why we are using Git?
Git allow group people to work on the same document (code) at the same time. Like we over come the code conflict by using Git if multiple people working at same time. That why we use git. 
It eliminate confusion when more person are making changes to save code.

CMD Command for Git
1.	Git init : is used to cerate new git repository
2.	Git clone : is used to clone repository
3.	Git log: is used to see history like how many  people commit code
4.	Git branch: is used to see how many branches.
5.	Git push : is used to push the code
6.	Git pull: is used to pull code.

Like here we have condition like we have to print pattern like in which contain 4 rows and each row star size is increasing by 2  like in 1st row there is 1 star and 2nd 3 ,3rd 5 like this way so  to print this pattern 
1st we count how many rows are present then we give outer for loop for row and inner for loop for column.
Here row are 4 and so we give condtion like i≤4 then this loop will print 4 rows and in each row star size is increasing by 2 means column size is changing.
Then 
1s we count how many stars in 1st row  i.e. 1 then we store it in variable i.e. int s=1;
public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int s=1;
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=s;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			s=s+2;
		}
		
	}

And as in each row star number is increasing by 2 that why we give s=s+2 so this will increase the s value by 2 after execution of one row is completed
// execution 
Here for 1st row I value is 1 and we have condition like i≤4 i.e. true then controller enter in  loop then it check inner loop here we give inner for loop to print column j=1 and give condition j≤s i.e. j≤1 i.e. true then controller enter in loop and in that loop we give print statement to print * in that same row / line we use print because this inner loop is applicable for one row multiples column. After  printing star then to move controller on next line we use empty println statement.  Then as we want to increment s value by 2 two then we use s=s+2;
Then s value is increment by 2 then execution of one line is completed then I value is get incremented by 1 i.e. i++ then check condition i.e. 2≤4 i.e true then controller will enter  in loop body and then execute inner for here we give condition like j=1;j≤s i.e. condition true i.e. j≤3 then controller will enter in loop body and execute print statement then 1 start is get  printed then controller increment j value by 1 and i.e. j=2 and then check condtion i.e. j≤3 that true and again execute print statement like this way until out for loop condition get false till then loop will get execute and we get our pattern.

With same logic just 1st we count how many rows are there and we give outer for loop for that 
i.e., 4 rows are there. 
Then we count how many stars in 1st line i.e., 5 then we mention in variable and that variable we mention in inner for loop. 
Like 
int s=5;
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=s;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			s=s-2;
		}
	Here are number of star in decreasing by two In each row that why we give s=s-2; then it will decrease s value by 2.

Star having spaces 
   *
  **

****

Like we have condition like 1st we have to print space and then we have to print star then we.
Step1: 1st we calculate total number of rows how many rows are there i.e.4 then we give outer for loop for row and we give condition to print 4 rows. 
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
step2: we give inner for loop for columns. 
But here in row 1 we have to print 3 spaces and then we have to print 1 star.
So we declare one variable for space 
i.e. 	int space=3; as there are 3 spaces are in row 1, here we print spaces because that are present before start. if there are space available before star then we have print that.
then we declare 2nd variable for star i.e int s=1;
here we give 2 inner for loop one for to print spaces and one inner for loop for to print star.
for(int j=1;j<=space;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(" ");
			}
In each inner for loop we only use print. 
Here give second inner for loop for to print star.
for(int k=1;k<=star;k++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
When all space and star print for one row then to move coursour on next line we give empty println statement.
When we navigate to next row then space value is decremented by one then we give space--; this will decrement space value by 1.
And when we star value is increasing by one then we give s++; this will increment star value by one. 
int space=3;
		int star=1;
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=space;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(" ");
			}
			for(int k=1;k<=star;k++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			space--;
			star++;
		}
	
Execution: 
Like in row 1 we have condition like i=1 and i≤4  condition is true then controller will enter loop body then execute 1st inner for loop to print spaces i.e. we have condtion like j=1 and we have condtion like j≤space i.e. j≤3 i.e. true then it will enter in loop body and execute print statement 3 time i.e. 3 paces once the execution of this loop complted then controller enter 2nd inner for loop and here we give conation like k=1 and k≤s i.e. 1≤1 i.e. true then it will enter loop body and execute print statement one time and print star then execution of 2nd inner for loop completed i.e. all space and star in row one is printed then we give empty println statement to move cursor on next line then we give space—which decrement space value by 1 i.e. 3 to 2 and then we give s++ which increment s value by one. i.e. 1to 2. Then controller increase value of I by one and i.e. 2≤4 condtition is true then enter in loop body and execute 1ts inner loop for two time because value of space 2 and print two spaces then it will execute 2nd inner for loop this will run for two time because s value is now two here 2nd row all spaced and star are printed then to move mouse pointer to next line we use empty println statement then we as we have condition  space—i.e. again it decrease value of space by one and then execute s++ i.e. increase s value by one i.e. 3 then again it increase value of I by one this loop will execute until outer loop condition get false until then we get our pattern printed.

   *
Like suppose have pattern like we have increase the spaces and decrease number start in row then.
1st we count how many  row are there i.e. 4  then we give outer for loop.
Then here in 1st row there is no space then we declare in variable i.e. int space=0;
Then in 1st row 4 start is present then we dealcre variable i.e. int star=4; 
Then we give two inner loop for loop  1st to loop for space and 2nd loop for to print star.
When all space and star are print for one row to move mouse pointer to next line we use empty println statement. 
Then in every row space value is increasing by 1. i.e. we give space++
Then in each row star values are decreasing by 1 i.e. we give star--.

int space=0;
		int star=4;
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=space;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(" ");
			}
			for(int k=1;k<=star;k++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			space++;
			star--;
		}
	}

Above logic and this logic is same jut we print in revers order.
Execution for 1st row controller will enter in loop body and execute 2nd inner loop directly because in 1st inner loop condition is false i.e. j=1 and we have condition j≤0 i.e. 1≤0 i.e. false i.e. don’t add space and directly execute  2nd inner loop and print 4 star and then after execution for that row is completed then empty println statement will move courser to next line then we add space++ which increment space value by 1 i.e. 0 to 1 and then we have star – i.e. decrement star value by 1 i.e. 3 then controller will increment value of I by 1 i.e. i++ . this loop will execute until outer loop condition get failed.

Like suppose we have condition to print above pattern.
Where start value is decreasing by 2 and space values are increasing by 1 then.
Here 1st we count how many rows are there i.e. 4 rows are there so we give outer for loop to print 4 rows. 
Then we count how many spaces are available in 1st row i.e. 0 spaces are available in 1st row. Then we declare in variable i.e. int space=0;. 
Then we count how many star are present in 1st row i.e. 7 then we declare 2nd variable i.e. int star=7;

Here to print multiple column of same row we use inner for loop here we are using two for loop 1st for loop to print space and 2nd for loop to print star in row.
When all sapces and star are print / execution one row is completed then we use empty println statement to move coursor to next line. 
Then as in every row space size is increasing by one then we give space++ which incerament space value by one 
And in each row value of star is decarsing by 2 that’s why we give star=star-2.
int space=0;
		int star=7;
		for(int i=1;i<=4;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=space;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(" ");

			for(int  k=1;k<=star;k++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			
			System.out.println();
			space++;
			star=star-2;
		}
	}

Here logic is same just star values are decreasing by 2 only. and space value is increasing by one.

Like we have condition like we have to print above pattern where star values are increasing by 2 and space are decreasing  by 1.
Here 1st we calculate how many row are there i.e. 4 rows are there then we give outer for loop for row and 
Then we count how many space are there i.e. 3 we declare in variable i.e. int space=3;
Then we count how many star in 1st row i.e. 1 then we declare in variable i.e. int star=1; then 

Here we give two inner for loop 1st for to print spaces and 2nd for to print star. Once execution of one row completed then then as we want to move cursor on next line for that we use empty println. Then as we want decrease space value by 1 in each row then we give space—
The as we want to increase value of star in each row by two then we then we give star=star+2;
After execution of one row completed then controller will increase value of I and execute until all row get printed or outer loop condition get false.
int space=3;

Pattern 13

*

Like we have condition like star value are increasing to middle row and after that star values are getting decreasing. Like we have 7 row star value are increasing to middle row i.e. 4 and after middle row star values are getting decreasing.
 
So here is logic we divide this code in two half.
In 1st half we have to increase the value of star by one from 1st row to up to middle row. 
So here we give outer row for number of rows are present i.e. 7 then we give for loop condition.
 Then we count how many star are present in 1st row i.e. 1 then we declare variable for that i.e. int star=1;
Then we give 
Inner for loop for column to print multiple column in one row. And we assign star value in that i.e. j≤star
Once then execution of one row is completed then we move cursor to next line 
Here we have to increase values of star up to middle and then we have to decrease  value of star by one then we give condition in if else block like

Here i decided the value of row for that we are giving condition for i i.e. outer for loop decide value of row. If i value is less than middle row i.e. 4 then increase value of star by one and once i value is greater than 4 i.e. middle row then decrease value of star by 1. 

public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int star=1;
		for(int i=1;i<=7;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=star;j++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			
			if(i<4)
			{
				star++;
			}
			else
			{
				star--;
			}
		
	}

Here we give total number of rows then we give increment and decrement in if else if i value is less than 4 then star value is increase by one and once i value is greater that 4 then it will decrease star value by one. Here from middle row we are increasing value and after that we are decreasing value of star.

This pattern is also same as above here star values are decreasing by 1 up to middle row and after that star value if getting increasing by 1 after middle row.
1st we count how many row are present i.e. 7 then we give outer for loop for row 
Then we count how many star are present in 1st row i.e. 4 then we declare in variable i.e. int star=4 
Then we give inner for loop to print multiple column in a one row. Here we mention star in inner for loop condition. 
When execution of one row is completed then we give empty println to move cursor on next line 
Then we give condition in if else as we have to decrease value of star upto middle row and then we have tp increase as we know row value is indicated by i  i.e. outer for loop then we give condition like
If  i  is less than middle row no. i.e. 4 then decrease value of star by 1 and else i  is greater than middle row no. I.e. 4 then increase value of star by one.
public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		int star=4;
		for(int i=1;i<=7;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=star;j++)

				star--;

				star++;

pattern 15 diamond
     

Like 1st we have to calculate how many row are there i.e. 7 then we give outer for loop condition to print row. 
Then we calculate how many spaces are in 1st row i.e. 3 then we declare it in a variable i.e. int space=3.
Then we count how many star are present in 1st row i.e. one then we store in it variable i.e. int star=1.
Then we give two inner for loop 1st loop for to print space and 2nd inner loop for to print star. 
Then we give empty print statement once execution of one row completed then cursor will move to next line then 

Here space are deceasing by 1 from 1st row to middle row and number of star are increasing by 2  up to middle row that i.e. 4 and after middle row no. of spaces are increasing by one and no. of star is decreasing by 2. 

Then we apply  condition like if value of i is less than middle row no. i.e.  4 then decrease value of space by one and increase value of star by two. And in else we give 
increase value of space by one  and we give star—decrease value of star by 2.
public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		int space=3;
		int star=1;
		
		for(int i=1;i<=7;i++)
		{
			for(int j=1;j<=space;j++)
			{
				System.out.print(" ");
			}
			
			for(int k=1;k<=star;k++)
			{
				System.out.print("*");
			}
			System.out.println();
			
			if(i<4)
			{
				space--;
				star=star+2;
			}
			else
			{
				space++;
				star=star-2;
			}
		}
		
	}
Here we give condition for I because i  indicate the row. If I value is less 4 then if part will get execute otherwise else part will get execute.  This loop continue until outer for loop condition get false. 


Jenkins 
Jenkins used to run one of test suite, test class we want to run at particular time. 
(like we set alarms like that same way we use Jenkins.)
Like to run one of test suite / test class at particular time then we use Jenkin which is an Web base application. 
In which we need some pre-requirement like 
1.	Path of class/ suite which we want to execute.
2.	Time at which we want to run that test suite.
3.	And we have to give email address where we want to publish report of that execution.
How to create new JOB?
To create Job, we need 
1.	Path of test suite
2.	Time at which we want to execute 
3.	Email address which we want to execute.
(this set up of Jenkin is done by Framework developer, then URL of Jenkin is send to us, then we also get URL and password.)( when we enter URL then we have to enter user name and password then we can get loin into system. then we navigate to Dashboard or home page)
On Dashboard we see option like 
New Item:
People 
Build history 
To create new Job we have to click on New Item, then we are redirected to page from where we can create new job.
 
 
When we click on New item then we see page in which it contains, Project name (Job name we can give any thigs is just for identification purpose ),(then we can add time then we can provide mail id).

Then we see option Build Triggers
Then we have to select 2nd option i.e. Build periodically.
 
By using then we can add time, like at which time we want to run like every day, or every week , each month, or after every 5 minute then we can assign by using build periodically. then small window will get open where we can mention time.

Then in execute Shell we have to mention the path of test suite or test class which we want to execute.
Then we have to scroll down then we see option,
Then we can mention our email also where we can get report of execution, then click on save job will get created.
Then time which we mention that test suite will run  on server where i.e. PC on which this Jenkins in configure with it and GitHub is also configured. Like suppose if we configure script and mention time then at that time script execution will start. Then we get mail on our email after execution is completed. 

 
How to modify/ configure / edit existing Job?
Like suppose we want to edit or configure existing Job then we can click on configure.
Like we want  to change timing of Job want to change job like 9 to 10 or whatever we want to give, or we want to change email id where we want to get report.
For that we can edit already created job, like
Here one job is already created 
 

 
Here we can see options like lats failure, last  duration.
Like to configure Job which is already created then we have to click on that Job name. then we navigate to Job Page  
Here  we see options like back to Dashboard, status, Build now  (for now we can run that it working or not ), then see option delete project.
 
Then see configuration option by which we can edit this existing job.
Then we see option i.e. Build history 
Which show result how many time this job was run what was it’s execution. 
 
Dot show in blue means pass and dot in read means failure result. So here we can see job history. 

To configure we have to click on Configure 
Then we will reflect on page where we can configure or same page where we can cerate new job.
Like page have project name, build triggers, and execute shell. 
Like we can give Job name, time at which time we want to run that, then we can give email id also where we want to get mail or report of execution.  Like here we can change job name, we can change time and date, and we can change mail id also. or we can change the path of test suit/class also.


Jenkins notes
Jenkins is an open source continuous Integration and development (CI/CD ) tool.
It available free of cost, we can  perform setup by downloading that.
an open source automation server which enables developers around the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.
It is support cross platform. Like on any operating system we can download it.
Like windows, Linux or IOS.
Jenkins is mainly used to schedule a particular job and monitor any Job or application setup. (it will schedule job and it will inform status of Job)
It fires precondition actions when a particular state occurs. (Like we can apply precondition and post conditions before or after job execution mostly not use)

Features of Jenkins 
1.	It generates list of all changes done in in the repository.( we can integrate  Jenkins with GitHub also, like if we make any changes is GitHub then we can track from Jenkins also.)
2.	Can be configured with email 
3.	We can save the Test reports and execution history. (Like we can see how many time we run that script and every time we get report of that execution on our email and also save that reports and we can see all history of scripts from where setup the Jenkins and run script form it to till now it store all execution history and result.)  
4.	Jenkins support maven for bulding and Testing a project.( Jenkins supports maven, it execute maven project on, mention time)

Crone pattern 
In Jenkins time is mention by using crone pattern.
Like at which time we want to run the script. Like 10pm , 12pm etc.  
 Then we have to follow crone pattern.
Crone pattern, it contains 5 start      (star  meaning means all.)
Like we provide value of star.
 List 1st star represent / decide minute in hours at which minute we want to run that script.
2nd star decide hour in one day means at which hour we want to run script like 1 am ,13 pm, 23 pm etc. like 9.15 then 9 is hour and 15 min then we condition like
15 9 * * *        so it will run 9 am and 15 min.
3rd star decides day of month like 1 to 31. Like in month at which date or day that script has to run like 5th ,or 31 like this why we can give date. Like 
15 9 31 * *  means this will run script on dated 31st  on 9 am and 15 min.
4th star decide month like on which month we want to run that script like  1 to 12 like jan feb  etc.
Like 15 9 31 1 * like this will run script on 31st jan at 9am and 15 min.
5th star decide day of week, at which day of week we run that script like 0-7. Like Monday, tue, etc.
Like 15 9 31 1 1 means this will run Monday, in January 31st at 9 am and 15 min.
 

MINUTE Minutes within the hour (0–59)
HOUR   The hour of the day (0–23)
DOM    The day of the month (1–31)
MONTH  The month (1–12)
DOW    The day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.

Ex.
Every we have to run script every day, in every month of year at, 15th min of 13th hour then we give 
15 13 * * * (star represent every day in month and very day)
Every day after 5 min we have to run script.
*/5 * * * *  (here we give */5 (all/5) at place of min means it will run script every day after every 5 min).
Like we have to run script at 8 am then we give min 0.
0 8 * * *
(Job means combine all test suite, time, test suite path and email id where we get report.  Job we just do regression so we schedule job for regression)
(We can schedule job from any where but it will run on that server where we configure with Jenkins.)  (if eclipse is close then it will open that then start execution).
Reports we like extent report and email report we get on our mail.(it only forward report generated after execution like emailable or extent reports)

Command to start jenkins
Java -jar Jenkins.war
If we want to run script from local machine then in source code management we have to choose none and we have to give pom.xml path and set goal test.

Difference between string and String builder / string builder 
String 	String builder /string builder 
String class is immutable.
(like if we cerate object of string class then we can’t modify it that object is final. And we want to reinitialize it then it don’t make changes in old object it create new object and make changes in that. Like if we create object s1 =ab; and we want to add/ concat cd with ab then it don’t add new info in existing object it create new object and store info in that.)
String class is immutable:
•	Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.
•	Any modification to a String creates a new object in memory, which can lead to inefficiency and increased memory consumption when performing multiple modification
	String Buffer class is mutable.
Like we can make changes in existing variable / object. Like we reinitialize or make change in it store in existing object. 
StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes are mutable, which means you can modify their values directly without creating new objects. They are more efficient when you need to perform multiple modifications on the same string.
String class is slow and consume more memory when we concat too many string because every time it create new instance or copy of object.
(when we perform reinitialization  then string is slow as compared to string buffer or string builder) 
(when we reinitialize then it don’t make changes in existing object it will create copy of object every time and store changes in that. By combining old info and new info it store in new instance  of object to perform all this string take some that why string is slow as compared with string buffer/ builder. Every time while initializing it create new object that why it is slow and consume more memory)
String is slower and consumes more memory when concatenating multiple strings because it creates new instances for each concatenation, resulting in more memory usage.	In string buffer/ builder is fast and consume less memory when we concat string.
(because this are mutable means like if we reinitialize  objects  1000 time then also it store that info in existing object it  don’t create new objects  i.e. it fast and consume less memory )

On the other hand, StringBuilder and StringBuffer are faster and consume less memory when concatenating strings because they modify the existing object without creating new ones.
If we don’t have to perform reinitialization then string is better.	If we have to perform reinitialization many time  then string is better
String is final class.	Is Not final class.

1. diffrence between String & Stringbuffer/Stringbuilder
   
		   String                     				 StringBuffer/Stringbuilder
	1. String class is immutable.				StringBuffer/Stringbuilder class is mutable.

	2. String is slow and consumes more memory when		StringBuffer is fast and consumes less memory when you cancat strings.
	   you concat too many strings because every time
	   it creates new instance.


-----------------------

2.	Difference between string buffer and string builder 
String buffer class	String builder class
String buffer was introduced/developed  in java 1.0 version it is legacy class.
(legacy/old classes is always slow as compared with latest class)
StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0, making it a legacy class. Legacy classes are older and may have slower performance compared to newer classes.	String builder introduced in java 1.5. is not legacy class. (string builder is  latest class)
1.	StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5 and is not a legacy class. It is the latest class for string manipulation.

String buffer  class performance is low as compared with string builder.
1.	StringBuffer is slower in performance compared to StringBuilder. The reason is that StringBuffer is synchronized and thread-safe, meaning it can perform only one task at a time, which affects its speed.
	String builder class performance is high as compared with string buffer class.
1.	StringBuilder, on the other hand, is faster because it is not synchronized and not thread-safe. It can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making it more efficient for string manipulations.

(in java class which have low performance then that class have synchronized and thread safe)
Synchronized and thread safe  means at time it can perform only one task.
1.	If you need thread safety (i.e., when multiple threads are accessing the same StringBuffer), then StringBuffer is the appropriate choice, despite its slightly lower performance.

	(class which have high performance then it is not synchronized and no thread safe)
Not synchronized and not thread safe means at time it can perform multiple tasks.
1.	If thread safety is not a concern, StringBuilder is the preferred choice due to its higher performance.

	


2. diffrence between Stringbuffer & Stringbuilder

	Stringbuffer							Stringbuilder
StringBuffer was introduced in Java 1.0(Legacy)                 StringBuilder was introduced in Java 1.5  (not Legacy)  

performance: low					       	performance: High

synchronized & Thread safe					not synchronized & not Thread safe

3.	Difference between HashMap and Hash Table
 Hash Table( Hash Table is implementation class of MAP. )
store data in key-value pairs	HashMap ( it is implementation of class of Map which is interface which have many sub interface and implementation classes.)
store data in key-value pairs
Hash Table is legacy class. 	Hash Map is not legacy class. it is least class.
Performance of Hash table is low 	
Performance of Hash Map is high
Hash table is synchronized and thread safe.	Hash Map is not synchronized and not thread safe.
( Hash map and hash table store data in keys and value format.)
In Hash Table no null key and null values are allowed.(  hash table don’t allow null values as well as null keys.)	(Hash map and hash table store data in keys and value format.)
   In Hash many one null key and multiple null values 
Hash Table iterator is not fail-safe	 HashMap iterator is fail-safe 
It is introduced in the 1.0 version	
It is introduced in the 1.2 version.


In HashMap data is stored randomly in object i.e. its depends on ascii value data having lowest value will store first.
LinkedHashMap is stored data in order manner .i.e. order of insertions is maintained in LinkkedHashMap.

3. diffrence between Hashmap & HashTable

   		HashMap                       Hashtable
	1. not legacy class		legacy class

        2. performance: high		performance: low

	3. HashMap is non synchronized  HashTable is synchronized. 
	   It is not-thread safe         It is thread safe

	4. 1 null key & any null value   no null key & value 

What is difference between Map and collection ?
In Collection data is stored in object single object form   but in Map data is stored in pair of keys and values. Both Collection and map are interfaces.
--------------------------------------
4.	Diff between final, finally & finalize



Final 	Finally 	Finalize
final is key word. ( like final is key word like if we mention / declare variable by using final then variable value is constant means we can’t change it, or reinitialization is not possible.)
(
And if we declare class as final then we can’t perform inheritance on that class)  
final: In Java, final is a keyword used to create constants or make elements immutable. If a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once assigned. Additionally, if a class is marked as final, it cannot be subclassed or extended, preventing inheritance.
final is used for constants and immutability,	finally is block.
In java expectation handling to execute the important code whether the exception occur or not.
(when we use try and catch block to handle exception, then if exception is occur then compiler will enter in catch block if exception is not occur then compiler don’t visit in catch block ) but we have condition like if expectation is occur or not occur then we have to run some code then we mention that code in finally block. Finally block is used immediately after catch block. Then we enter important code in that if exception is occur then also it run or if exception is not occur then also code in finally block will execute.
(it directly execute finally block)


finally: In Java, finally is a block used in exception handling. It is placed after the try and catch blocks. The code inside the finally block will always be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It is commonly used to perform important cleanup or resource release operations.

finally is used for executing important code irrespective of exceptions	finalize is method present in java, this method is present in garbage collector class.
this method is used, after execution of each class, the class contains many methods, variables so here some memory location is done. Like when we declare variable then some memory space is allocated to that variable. 
this method is used to release the memory allocation after class execution is completed.
This method is automatically called by JVM once class execution is completed. This method is present in garbage collector class.
(like when we declare variable or when we create object then some memory space is allocated them, then after execution of class this method is used release or clean the memory space allocate by variable and object)

finalize(): It is a method present in the Java's garbage collector class. When a class contains methods and variables, it allocates memory space in the system. The finalize() method is called automatically by the JVM after the execution of a class is completed. It is used to release or clean up the memory space allocated to objects and variables used in the class.

finalize() is used to clean up memory after the execution of a class.

Final: is a keyword
Finally: finally is the block in Java Exception Handling to execute the important code whether the exception occurs or not
Finalize: finalize is the method in Java which is used to perform clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.


5.	Diff between Throw & Throws
throws (key word)	Throw(key word)
Throws is used to handle predefined exceptions (like used to handle expectation present java)
Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare an exception which might be thrown by the function while the execution of the code.	Throw is used to handle user defined exceptions. ( like developer also can create their own expectation like one operation is perform then this type of exception is occur so to handle this type of user defined exception throw key word is used )
 (We can create exception in another class then we can all that expectation when we required)
Java throws keyword is used in the method signature to declare an exception which might be thrown by the function while the execution of the code.	
Java throw keyword is used throw an exception explicitly in the code, inside the function or the block of code.


public void readFile() throws IOException, FileNotFoundException {
    // code for reading a file
}
	

throws is used with the method signature	throw" is used to throw an exception explicitly within a method or block of code,
The throws keyword is followed by class names of Exceptions to be thrown.
	throw is used within the method.

We can declare multiple exceptions using throws keyword that can be thrown by the method. For example, main() throws IOException, SQLException.	
We are allowed to throw only one exception at a time i.e. we cannot throw multiple exceptions.

	The throw keyword is followed by an instance of Exception to be thrown.
public void divide(int dividend, int divisor)
 {
    if (divisor == 0) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Divisor cannot be zero");
    }
    int result = dividend / divisor;
    System.out.println("Result: " + result);
}

These both are used to handle executions. (if don’t handle the expectation then further execution of program is not possible so it is mandatory to handle exception during the before execution of java program.
Throw: use to handle user defined exception
Throws: use to handle pre-defined exception
What is method chaining?
Method chaining means one method call another method. In method chaining method return object and from that object we are calling another method.
Like 
driver.mange().window().maximize();

in java, method chaining is the methods being called one after another.
How to handle exception and which type of exceptions you handled?
By using throws or try and catch block we can handle exception.
Exceptions like null pointer expectation, session not created, alter exception etc.
Override concept in framework where is used?
In selenium architecture internally get() and navigate().to() methods are redefine or there definition are updated as per that browser class specifications.
All method which are completed  in remote webdriver implementation class that all methods are overridden methods. 
Declaring method in one class/ interface and completed in other class this type of method are also called overridden method.

Inspect all element in single xpath expression?
For this we have to find parent element then all child element are get highlighted.

What is diffrence between assert (hard assert) and verify (soft assert)?
In hard assert if test scripts have multiple validation are available but if one of validation get failed then it skips remaining validation but in soft assert or verify if one of validation get failed then also it will check all validation for that test script.
Which database used in your framework?
In Case of automation, we don’t use database for input we use excel sheet to store inputs.

What is listener?
Listener is as interface, by which we can get status of test case which is executed currently i.e. ITestResult . In listener’s there are various sub listeners are present by which we can do some configuration in extent reports or testNG reports by using ITestListener.

How to add explicitly wait on hidden element?
As we are using POM with Page factory so all hidden element are handle or mange by this design pattern but first we have to perform action element then hidden element get available then  we can perform action them.
We have to use explicitly wait when we have wait for element to be loaded. Like logo to be load 
Utility class method 
public static void waitUntilElementVisible(WebDriver driver, By locator, int timeout) {
    WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, timeout);
    wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(locator));
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
driver.get("https://www.example.com");

// Wait for the element with the id "myElement" to be visible.
waitUntilElementVisible(driver, By.id("myElement"), 10);

// Do something with the element.
WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("myElement"));
element.click();
How to enter input in input field without using sendkeys()?
By using javascript executor we can add input in input field.
public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
        driver.get("https://www.example.com");

        WebElement inputField = driver.findElement(By.id("myInput"));

        // Enter text into the input field using JavaScript.
        JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver;
        js.executeScript("document.getElementById('myInput').value='Hello, world!'");

runtime xpath?
like we get all links by using //a and we want click on only which contain sign up then to perform comparison run time runtime xpath is used.
How do you check logs in your framework? 
To generate logs we have implemented log4J2 decencies’ in our project save all logs in logs folder and all logs are stored in that folder log files are store for there we can read load messages.
And extension on this file .log
As an automation Tester, you pushed the correct code in GitHub but when Test lead pull that code that time the code show error. So, what are the reason behind this?
Maybe there is code conflict. Which occur when 2 people are working on same file and both are code are overlapping on same number of lines. Then Test lead only check this type of situation if this happen then he will push person 1 code into master and inform person 2 to download updated code and then put his code after that.
•	The code may be incompatible with the test lead's environment. The test lead may be using a different version of the software or a different operating system than you are. Make sure that the code is compatible with the test lead's environment.
•	The code may have been corrupted during the transfer. This is less likely, but it is possible. Try pushing the code again and see if that resolves the issue.

Where you do automation in your project?
We implement automation to reduce manual effort and carry out repetitive and time-consuming task like regression testing and compatibility testing.

What do you know about java hashtable?
It is an implementation class of map interface in data is stored in key and value pair.
If you don’t have any type of data then how can we perform testing?
This is ad hoc testing, but we can automate ad hoc test cases.

How frequently you gave release in your organization?
After 6 month or 1year or 3 months it depends on project how big and complex projects is. We gave release after every 6 months.

How your start automation? Explain your project Automation Strategy?
In my current role I am working in hybrid mode so on every new we test that feature manually first when we observer that now this feature is stable and no more changes are going to happen in that then as team we discuss and list out test case which can be automated like regression related test cases which we have to execute frequently and every sprint we select them and start automating them. Then in every sprint in 1st phase we start execution of test suite then we after that we have to analyze the report generated how many of test are  passed failed and what is reason behind that it can be any thing like environmental related issue or script error or actual bug if there are then we analyze and solve any environmental or script error of failed test cases and rerun only failed test cases and if in second phase also if some test cases get failed then we test that test cases manually because there might be defect that why test case may get failed. Then we have check Jira broad is same bug is already raised or not if its available then we forward that bug but if its totally new bug then we will raise that bug on Jira. This same process we have to follow.

What is Junit?
Its old version of TestNG Junit means java unit framework. TestNG is Next Generation Test. Its next generation Java Unite framework.
Where you perform regression testing?
In every module we use regression testing to ensure that due to new code modification or integration of new module all modules is in project are working flawless to ensure we regression testing.

Which selenium you are using?
Selenium 4.7.0 we are using but new version is selenium 4.12.0
How many percent of automation is implemented in your project?
40 manual 60 automation it depends on stable features available in project as project in final stages.
(If project is new then manual percentage is more and in last stage of project, we have more stable feature so automation percentage will increase).

Where do you store test data and screenshot?
In test data folder we store all our test cases in excel file and we store screenshot in screenshot folder for every sprint sub folder created in project.

What you do in initial stage of project?
As an automation tester we involve in create user define / common function in utility class and in involve in manual testing when we found some stable features after 4-5 sprint, we start automating test cases related to them.
Find xpath of highest price of product from autosuggestion?
For this we have to create xpath for element which highlights price of all products form auto suggestion then we have to sort them return web element of last position  
//div[@class='_13oc-S']//div [@class='_30jeq3 _1_WHN1']

What are precedent siblings?
To navigate parent to child and vise vera precedent sibling is use it belong to xpath axis’s  for advanced xpath. 

How to test payment related features?
We use dummy data to test that we check that transaction is working properly or not.

Webdriver manager how to use it?
WebDriver driver = WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();

Which database you use for testing?
We use excel sheet to maintain data we don’t use JDBC connections.in case of automation.
Where do collection in your project?
When we work findElements() which return list of webElements here we use collection like this   type   which we switch to  child  window then we have to use getWindoHandles() which return set<String> so it also collection like the type we directly or in directly use collection.
If you want to automate video so how automate them?
By using selenium, it not possible we have to use third party tool. Like auto IT.

If in project continues changes are going so is automation is possible?
No. because in every sprint we have to modify the script so automation is not possible on that.
As tester if you found bug on last day of sprint? 
As Tester we have to find defect this is our job, we can assign highest priority if its prior bug, we simply revert it to developers to fix it so its developer’s responsibility to fix this bug.
Explain testNG flags?
@Test - This is the most basic flag and is used to mark a method as a test method.
@BeforeSuite - This flag is used to run a method before the execution of all test methods in a suite.
@AfterSuite - This flag is used to run a method after the execution of all test methods in a suite.
@BeforeTest - This flag is used to run a method before the execution of each test method in a class.
@AfterTest - This flag is used to run a method after the execution of each test method in a class.
@BeforeClass - This flag is used to run a method before the execution of all test methods in a class.
@AfterClass - This flag is used to run a method after the execution of all test methods in a class.
@Parameters - This flag is used to pass parameters to a test method.
@DataProvider - This flag is used to define a data provider that can be used to pass data to test methods.
-d or --dry-run: This flag tells TestNG to print the test methods that would be run, but not actually run them. This can be useful for debugging test scripts.
-l or --listener: This flag specifies the class name of a listener class that will be used to listen to test events.
-m or --method: This flag specifies the name of a test method to run.
-p or --parameter: This flag specifies a parameter to pass to a test method.
-r or --report: This flag specifies the name of the report file that will be generated.
-t or --testclass: This flag specifies the name of a test class to run.
-u or --suite: This flag specifies the name of a test suite to run.

Open the TestNG project in Eclipse.
Right-click on the test suite that you want to run and select "Run as" > "TestNG Suite".
In the "TestNG Suite" dialog, select the "Arguments" tab.
In the "Arguments" tab, add the -d or --dry-run flag.
Click on the "Run" button.
What are share library in Jenkins?
To add supporting libraries, share library are use. To carry out different types of jobs.

How to find xpath without using index?
Then we have to use advanced xpath 
How you find bug by automation?
When we run script if it’s failed then we have to analyze why its failure if there is script error or environmental error then we rerun it if then also it fails then means actual result and expected result if not matching then we test this test manually also to ensure if its actual bug then we raise it.

How you do report in your organization?
At end of day, I mail team lead.
 Are you developing framework?
No, I don’t get chance to develop framework but I contribute in that by creating command function. But if needed then I can develop.

Which is most critical bug you found?
If found blocker defect on product specification page any blocker defect. 

If bug was found at last day of sprint, then what is your approach?
If bug is not impacting on business of project or if bug is not blocker defect then it will be solved in next sprint. 
Xpath Axes / advanced Xpath 
•	starts-with
starts-with function is very useful in finding dynamic web Elements.
•	You can use it to match the starting value of web element which remain static or fix some values are static and some values are changing when we refresh the web page. 
•	Ex. Id=session62354624, id=session47845145
Like here in this attribute id value starting value is fix but value after that is changing.
•	starts-with function can also find element whose attribute value is static or fix.

Syntax:
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute,’value’)]
//tagname[starts-with(text(),’value’)]

•	This starts-with function is useful if attribute value is changing after refresh of web page like id=session is static but number is changing.

•	and or operators 
•	and or operators are use to find unique web element if any unique attribute is not present.
•	and or operator are very useful if you want to use more than two attribute to find element single unique web element on web page.
•	Syntax
//tagname [@attribute =’value’ or @attribute=’value’]
//tagname [@attribute = ‘value’ and @attribute=’value’]


Xpath axes Methods 
It represent a relationship to the current (context) node.it is used in locating node relative to that node in tree.
•	Parent
•	Select the parent of the current node.
•	Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//parent∷tagname
•	Child
•	select all children of current node.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’vlaue’]//child∷tagname
•	Self
•	Select the current node.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//self∷tagname

These methods are use when unique attribute value is note available to current node then to identify element uniquely these methods are use.

•	descendant 
•	it selects all of descendant (children, grandchildren, etc.) of current node.
•	Syntax 
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//descendant∷tagname

•	Descendant-or-self 
•	It selects current node and all of it’s descendant like (child, grandchild, etc.)  if  tagname for descendant and self are same.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//descendant-or-self∷tagname
•	ancestor
•	ancestor selects all the ancestor (parent, grandparent, etc.) of current node.
•	Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//ancestor∷tagname
•	ancestor-or-self
•	it selects current node and all its ancestor like parent, grand parent, etc. if tagname of ancestor and self are same.
•	Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]/ancestor-or-self∷ tagname
•	Following 
•	Following selects all the nodes that appear after the current node.
•	Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//following∷tagname
It doesn’t check for parent.
•	Following-sibling
•	It selects all the node that have same parent as the current node and appear after current node.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//following-sibling∷tagname

•	Preceding 
•	It selects all nodes that appear before the current node.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//preceding∷tagname

•	Preceding-sibling
•	It selects all the node which appear before the current node if they same parent as current node
•	It selects all the node that have same parent as current node and appear before the current node.
•	Syntax
//tagname[@attribute=’value’]//preceding-sibling∷tagname
